<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE WINNER OF THE MILE</small></h2>


<p>“All out for the mile!”</p>

<p>Myer, clerk of the course, stuck his head inside the
dressing-tent and bawled the command in a voice already
made hoarse by his afternoon’s duties. In response a
dozen or so fellows gathered their blankets or dressing-gowns
about them and tumbled out into the dusk of a
mid-October evening. Because of the fact that on
Wednesday and Saturday afternoons the athletic field
was required for the football contests it was necessary to
hold the Fall Handicap Meeting on one of the other days
of the week. This year it was on Friday, October 17th,
and because the Erskine College faculty does not permit
athletic contests of any sort to begin before four o’clock
on any day save Saturday, the mile run, the last event
on the program, was not reached until almost six o’clock;
and in the middle of October in the latitude of Centerport
it is almost dark at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was cold, too. A steady north wind blew down
the home-stretch and made the waiting contestants dance
nimbly about on their spiked shoes and rub their bare
legs. That wind had helped the sprinters, hurdlers, and
jumpers very considerably, since it had blown against
their backs on the straightaway and the runway, enabling
them to equal the Erskine record in two cases and
break it in a third. It was Stearns, ’04, the track-team
captain and crack sprinter who, starting from scratch,
had performed the latter feat. Until to-day the Erskine
record for the 220-yards dash had been twenty-two seconds
flat; this afternoon, with the wind behind him all
the way, Stearns had clipped a fifth of a second from the
former time, to the delight of the shivering audience,
who had cheered the announcement of the result loudly,
glad to be able to warm themselves with enthusiasm on
any pretext.</p>

<p>But if the north wind had been kind to the sprinters,
the middle- and long-distance men had derived no benefit
from it; for while it aided them on the home-stretch, it
held them back on the opposite side of the field. The
spectators had already begun to stream away toward
college when Myer at length succeeded in getting the
last of the milers placed upon their marks. The two-mile
event had been tame, with Conroy, ’04, jogging
over the line a good twenty yards ahead of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
man, and there was no reason to expect anything more
exciting in the mile. Rindgely and Hooker were both
on scratch and surely capable of beating out any of the
ambitious freshmen, who, with a leavening of other
class men, were sprinkled around the turn as far as the
200 yards. To be sure, Rindgely and Hooker might
fight it out, but it was more probable that they had already
tossed a coin between themselves to see who was
to have first prize and who second. So the audience, by
this time pretty well chilled, went off in search of more
comfortable places than Erskine Field; or at least most
of them did; a handful joined the groups of officials
along the track, and jumped and stamped about in an
attempt to get the blood back into toes and fingers.</p>

<p>Clarke Mason was one of those electing to stay. Possibly
the fact that he had had the forethought to stop in
his room on his way to the field and don a comfortable
white sweater may have had something to do with his
decision. At least it is safe to say that the mere fact of
his being managing editor of the Erskine Purple was
not accountable, for the Purple had a small but assiduous
corps of reporters in its employment, one of whom, looking
very blue about the nose, Clarke spoke to on his way
across to where Stearns, having got back into his street
clothes, was talking to Kernahan, the trainer.</p>

<p>“Well, who’s going to win this, Billy?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Clarke. (The track trainer was “Billy” to only a select
few, and many a student, seeking to ingratiate himself
with the little Irishman, had had his head almost snapped
off for too familiar use of that first name.) Kernahan
looked over the contestants and nodded to the men on
scratch.</p>

<p>“One of them,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Then you have no infant prodigies for this event
in the freshman candidates?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any. Two or three of them may
turn out fast, but I guess they can’t hurry Hooker or
Rindgely much.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the chap you’ve got by himself over there
on the turn?” asked Stearns.</p>

<p>“That’s&mdash;I don’t mind his name; he’s a freshman
from Hillton; he wanted more handicap, but I couldn’t
give it to him, not with those legs of his. He’s built for
a runner, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“He surely is,” answered Stearns, “as far as legs are
concerned. But legs aren’t everything. Hello! you
haven’t given that little black-haired sophomore much of
a show; thirty yards won’t help him much in the mile.”</p>

<p>“Track, there!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>The three moved back on to the turf, Kernahan,
who was timer, pulling out his watch. The dozen or so
milers who had been summoned from the tent had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
their ranks increased by several others. Hooker and
Rindgely had the scratch to themselves, but the thirty
yards held three men scarcely less speedy, and from that
point onward around the turn as far as the middle of the
back-stretch the others were scattered in little groups of
twos and threes. Only the freshman with the long legs
was alone. He had been given a handicap of 120 yards,
and was jogging back and forth across the track with the
bottom of his drab dressing-gown flapping around his
slender ankles. Ahead of him in the gathering twilight
six other runners, in two groups, were fidgeting about in
the cold. Across the field floated the command to get
ready. He tossed his wrap aside, revealing a lithe figure
of little above medium height with long legs in which
the muscles played prettily as he leaned forward with
outstretched arm. At the report of the pistol he sprang
away with long easy strides that seemed to eat up the
distance. At the beginning of the home-stretch he had
caught up the nearest bunch of runners, and at the mark
he was speeding close behind the foremost men and taking
the pace from the leader. It had cost him something
to gain the position, and to the watchers about
the finish it seemed that he was already spent.</p>

<p>“Your long-legged freshman’s done for, I guess,”
said Clarke.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s too ambitious. Has a pretty stride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
though, hasn’t he, Billy?” Walter Stearns followed the
freshman runner with his gaze while he began the turn.
Kernahan too was watching him, and with something
like interest. But all he said was:</p>

<p>“Stride’s pretty good; feet drag a good deal,
though.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that closing up?” asked Stearns. “Oh, it’s
the sophomore chap with the black hair. He’s an idiot,
that’s what he is. Look! he’s trying to pass Long-legs.
There he goes! Long-legs has sense, anyhow. Sophomore’s
taken the lead, and look at the pace he’s making!
Long-legs is dropping back; none but a fool would try to
keep up to that.”</p>

<p>They were at the turn now, and the gathering darkness
made it difficult to determine who was who. So the
watchers gave their attention to the scratch-men and one
or two stragglers who were bunched together half-way
down the back-stretch. Rindgely and Hooker were close
together, the latter putting his toes down squarely into
the former’s prints. Both were running easily and with
the consciousness of plenty of power in reserve. When
the turn was begun they had gained slightly on the
others near them and were about 120 yards behind the
first bunch. The black-haired sophomore was still setting
the pace when he crossed the mark again. Behind
him at short intervals sped four others, and last in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
group came the freshman with the long legs. The half-hundred
spectators that remained were clustered close
to the track near the finish and, in spite of chattering
teeth, were displaying some enthusiasm. A junior
named Harris who was running third was encouraged
lustily, but most of the applause was reserved for the
two cracks, Rindgely and Hooker; they were well
known and well liked; besides, they were pretty certain
to win, and it is always satisfactory to back
the victor.</p>

<p>“What’s this, the third lap?” Clarke asked, thumping
his bare hands together. “Well, I’m going back;
better come along, Walt. You’ll freeze here. If we’re
going to have this sort of weather in October, I’d like to
know what’s going to happen to us in December.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll go along,” Stearns said. “It
surely is cold, and we know how this is going to end.
There go Rindgely and Hooker now; watch ’em overhaul
the bunch. If you see Ames, Billy, tell him I said
he was to look me up to-night, will you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the trainer. “But you’d
better see this out; there’s something in the way of a
finish coming pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up?” asked the track-team captain,
turning quickly to observe the runners.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know for sure,” answered Kernahan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cautiously, “but the scratch-men aren’t going to get
their mugs without a fight for them, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“Who’s in the running?” Stearns asked, eagerly.
Once more the first men were coming down the home-stretch.
But now the order was changed. The black-haired
sophomore was not in sight, but in his place sped
Hooker, an easy, confident smile on his face. On his
heels was Rindgely. Then came the junior, Harris, and
beside him, fighting for the pole, was a little plump
senior. Behind this pair and about five yards distant
was the long-legged freshman. His head was held well,
but his breathing was loud and tortured. Stearns looked
each man over searchingly. Then he turned to the
trainer.</p>

<p>“Last lap! Last lap!” was the cry.</p>

<p>“Say, Billy, you don’t mean Harris?” shouted
Stearns when he could make himself heard.</p>

<p>Kernahan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then who?”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes on Ware,” said the trainer.</p>

<p>“Ware? Who the dickens is Ware?” asked Stearns.
But the trainer was scattering the spectators from beside
the finish, and so paid no heed. The stragglers were passing
now and the crowd was speeding them along with announcements
that the last lap had begun and with mildly
ironical injunctions to “move up head” or “cut across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the field.” Then all eyes were turned to the back-stretch,
where the five leaders, survivors of a field of some fifteen,
were racing along, dim whitish forms in the evening twilight.
Hooker was setting a hot pace now, and the gaps
were lengthening. But as the last turn was reached the
figures changed their positions; some one dropped back;
some one else moved suddenly to the front. But it was
all a blur and the identity of the runners could be only
surmised.</p>

<p>“That’s Rindgely taking the lead, I guess,” said
Stearns. “That means that Hooker’s to sprint the last
fifty yards or so and get first. But I’d like to know who
Ware is. Do you know?”</p>

<p>Clarke shook his head.</p>

<p>“Search me,” he answered. “Maybe it’s the long-legged
chap. He’s still in the bunch, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he was just about done up when the last
lap was finished. Did you notice? He was gasping.
Where’s Billy?”</p>

<p>“Over there at the mark. He’s holding a watch; if
you speak to him now he’ll jump down your throat.
Here they come. Let’s move over here where we can
see.”</p>

<p>“Well, whoever’s in the lead is making a mighty
painful pace for the finish of the mile,” exclaimed the
captain. “Seems to me he’s ’way ahead, too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t Rindgely,” said Clarke, decisively. “It
must be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come on, Freshman!” cried a mighty voice at
Clarke’s elbow, and a big broad-shouldered youth
crashed by, sending the editor of the Purple reeling on
to the cinders, from where he was pulled back by Stearns.
Clarke glared around in search of the cause of his ignominious
performance, and saw him standing, a whole
head above the crowd, a few paces away at the edge of
the track. He seemed to be quite unconscious of
Clarke’s anger. Leaning out over the cinders, he was
waving a big hand and bellowing in a voice that drowned
all other cries:</p>

<p>“Come on, Freshman! Dig your spurs in!
<em>Whoo-ee!</em>”</p>

<p>Clarke’s anger gave way to excitement. Down the
home-stretch came the runners, sprinting for the mark.
Stearns was shouting unintelligible things at his side
and apparently trying to climb his back in order to see
the finish. The throng was yelling for Hooker, for
Rindgely, for Harris.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, comparative silence fell.
Twenty yards away the runners became recognizable.
The crowd stared in wonderment. Well in the lead and
increasing that lead with every long, perfect stride came
an unknown, a youth with pale cheeks disked with crimson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a youth of medium height with lithe body and long
legs that were working like parts of machinery. Back
of him ran Hooker; beyond, dim figures told of a struggle
between Rindgely and the junior for third place. It
was the stentorian voice of the big fellow at the edge of
the track that broke the momentary silence of surprise.</p>

<p>“Pull up, Freshman, it’s all yours!” it shouted.</p>

<p>Then confusion reigned. The little throng raced
along the track toward the finish. Hooker’s friends
urged him to win, while others applauded the unknown.
And in a second it was all over, mile race and fall
meeting. <a href="#image02">A white-clad form sped across the finish six</a>
yards in the lead, tossed his arms in air, swerved to the
left, and pitched blindly into the throng.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Seven?” shrieked a small
youth at Stearns’s elbow. The track-team captain
turned.</p>

<p>“Who was that fellow that won?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Ware,” was the jubilant reply. “Ware, ’07!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A VISITING CARD</small></h2>


<p>When Allan Ware recovered enough to take an interest
in things he found himself lying in the dressing-tent
with some one&mdash;it afterward proved to be Harris&mdash;striving
to draw a coat from under him. No one was
paying any special attention to him, and the tent was
filled with the hard breathing of the runners, who were
now only intent upon getting into their clothes. Allan
took a deep breath and obligingly rolled over so that
Harris could have his coat. Then he sat up.</p>

<p>He had not fainted at the end of the race; it is
very seldom that a runner loses consciousness, no matter
how hard or prolonged the struggle has been. The
collapse is produced by oppression of the chest, less
frequently of the heart in particular, and the consequent
difficulty of breathing is the most painful feature
of it. Allan had been dimly aware from the moment
he pitched into the throng until now of what had passed,
but his interest in events had been slight; he knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
arms had reached out and saved him from falling and
that some one&mdash;a very strong some one, evidently&mdash;had
picked him up like a feather and carried him the short
distance to the tent. Allan wondered, now that he
could breathe again without exertion, who the fellow
had been.</p>

<p>Every one was intent upon dressing and no one
looked as though expecting thanks. Rindgely, still
blowing like a porpoise, was balancing himself on one
leg and trying to thrust the other into his trousers,
while he explained to Hooker that the track was like
mush and no one should be expected to run on it.
Hooker, looking amused, grunted as he pulled his shirt
over his head. Allan scrambled to his feet and began
to dress. He couldn’t help wondering what the others
thought of his victory; it seemed rather important to
him, but he had never won a race before, although he
had taken part in a good many, and so it probably
appeared more wonderful than it really was. The
trainer stuck his head in at the door.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, now,” he commanded. “Get up to
the gym, and don’t be afraid of the water when you
get there.”</p>

<p>This familiar formula met with the usual groans
and hoots, and Kernahan grinned about the tent.
Starting to withdraw his bullet-shaped head with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
scant adornment of carroty hair, the trainer’s eyes
fell on Allan. He picked his way over the tangle
of legs.</p>

<p>“Well, are you done up?” he asked. Allan shook
his head.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy, then!” continued Billy, heartily.
“You’d better come out Monday and we’ll see what
you can do. Did you ever run much?”</p>

<p>“Some,” answered Allan, “at school.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see me Monday.”</p>

<p>When the trainer had gone, Hooker called across:</p>

<p>“Say, Ware, you’re done for now.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“Why, when Billy takes a fancy to you, he just
merely works you to death. You weigh when you get
over to gym and then weigh again, say, three weeks
from now. You won’t know yourself.”</p>

<p>A laugh went up. Rindgely chimed in with:</p>

<p>“You’ll find your work different from winning a
mile with a couple of hundred yards handicap.”</p>

<p>Allan had only had one hundred and twenty, but
he didn’t think it worth while correcting Rindgely, who
was evidently rather sore over his defeat. Harris unexpectedly
took up for him.</p>

<p>“He didn’t have that much handicap, Larry; and
if he had, it wouldn’t have made any difference to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you old ice-wagon. What was the matter with you,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>Rindgely entered into elaborate explanations, which
concerned the state of the track, the injustice of the
handicapping, and many other things, and Harris
laughed them to scorn.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re just lazy,” he jibed. “Your name’s
Lazy Larry.”</p>

<p>A howl of delight went up, and Allan looked to see
Rindgely become angry. But, after a moment of indecision,
he added his chuckle to the general hilarity.
Allan turned to Harris.</p>

<p>“I was rather done up after the run,” he said,
“and some fellow must have lugged me over here.
Did you happen to see who he was?”</p>

<p>“Yes; one of your class, a whopping big fellow
named Burley. Know him, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Allan shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you will when you see him.”</p>

<p>Harris picked up his togs and hurried off. Allan
would have liked to walk back with him to the gym,
but he thought the junior might think him “fresh”
if he offered his company, and so he started back alone.
It was almost dark now, and the lights in the college
yard and in the village were twinkling brightly when
he reached the corner of Poplar Street and turned down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that elm-roofed thoroughfare toward his room. Poplar
Street ends at Main Street in a little triangular
grass-grown space known as College Park, and Allan’s
room was in the rambling corner house that faces the
park and trails its length along Main Street. Allan
thought his address sounded rather well: “1 College
Park” had an aristocratic sound that pleased him.
And since he had been unable to secure accommodations
in one of the dormitories, he considered himself lucky
to have found such comfortable quarters as Mrs.
Purdy’s house afforded.</p>

<p>His room was large, with two windows in front
reaching to the floor and four others arranged in couples
along the side, and affording a clear view of the college
yard, from McLean Hall to the library. The fact that
former denizens had left comfortable window-seats at
each side casement was a never-failing source of satisfaction
to the new occupant of what the landlady called
the “parlor study.” In Allan’s case, it was study and
bedroom too. Next year Allan meant to room in the
Yard, and for the present he was very well satisfied.</p>

<p>His occupancy of less than a month had not staled
the pleasure derived from knowing himself sole owner
of all the apartment’s array of brand-new furniture,
carpeting, and draperies. To-night, after he had
lighted all four of the burners in the gilded chandelier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
above the table, he paused with the charred match in
hand and looked about him with satisfaction.</p>

<p>The carpet was beautifully crimson, the draperies
at the windows were equally resplendent, if more variegated
in hue, the big study-table shone richly and reflected
the light in its polished top, and the more
familiar objects on the mantel and on the dark walls,
accumulations of his school years, seemed to return
his gaze with friendly interest. To-night, with the
knowledge of his victory on the track adding new
glamour to the scene, it seemed to Allan that his first
year of college life was destined to be very happy and
splendid.</p>

<p>He stayed only long enough to change collar and
cuffs, and then, with a boy’s cheerful disregard of
economy, left the four lights flaring and hurried across
Main Street to Brown Hall and dinner.</p>

<p>The afternoon’s work had put a sharp edge on his
appetite, and, having nodded to one or two acquaintances,
he lost no time in addressing himself to the
agreeable task of causing the total disappearance of a
plate of soup. His preoccupation gives us an excellent
opportunity to make a critical survey of him without
laying ourselves open to the charge of impoliteness.</p>

<p>Allan Ware was eighteen years old, a straight, lithe
lad, with rather rebellious brown hair and a face still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
showing the summer’s tan. His features were not perfect
by any means, but they were all good, and if you
would not have thought of calling the face handsome,
you would nevertheless have liked it on the instant.
There was a clearness and steadiness about the brown
eyes, a gentleness about the mouth, and a firmness
about the chin which all combined to render the countenance
attractive and singularly wholesome. It was
a face with which one would never think of associating
meanness. And yet to jump to the conclusion that
Allan had never done a mean act would have been
rash; he was only an average boy, and as human as
any of them.</p>

<p>Allan had come up to Erskine from Hillton without
heralding; he was not a star football player, a brilliant
baseball man, nor a famous athlete; he had always run
in the distances at the preparatory school principally
because he liked running and not because he believed
himself cut out for a record breaker. His afternoon’s
performance had been as much of a surprise to him
as to any. At Hillton he had been rather popular
among his set, but he had never attempted to become
a leader. His classmates had gone to other colleges&mdash;many
to Harvard and Yale, a few to Columbia and
Princeton, only one to Erskine. Allan had chosen the
latter college to please his mother; his own inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
had been toward Yale, for Allan had lived all his life
in New Haven, and was blue all through.</p>

<p>But Allan’s grandfather had gone to Erskine&mdash;his
name was one of those engraved on the twin tablets in
the chapel transept, tablets sacred to the memories of
those sons of Erskine who had given their lives in the
struggle for the preservation of the Union&mdash;and Allan’s
father had gone there, too. Allan couldn’t remember
very much about his father&mdash;the latter had died when
the boy was ten years old&mdash;but he sympathized with
his mother’s wish that he also should receive his education
under the elms of Centerport.</p>

<p>His family was not any too well supplied with
wealth, but his mother’s tastes were simple and her
wants few, and there had always been enough money
forthcoming for the needs of his sister Dorothy, two
years his junior, and for himself. If there had been
any sacrifices at home, he had never known of them.
At Hillton he had had about everything he wanted&mdash;his
tastes were never extravagant&mdash;and the subject of
money had never occupied his thoughts. At eighteen,
if one is normal, there are heaps of things far more
interesting than money. One of them is dinner.</p>

<p>Allan was much interested in dinner to-night. He
even found it necessary to indulge in a couple of “extras,”
in order to satisfy a very healthy appetite. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
these he signed with an impressive flourish. When
the last spoonful of ice-cream had disappeared he
pushed back his chair and went out. In the coat-room
he found a dark-complexioned and heavily built youth
in the act of drawing on a pair of overshoes.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find my boots,” explained Hal Smiths,
“so I put these over my slippers. Wait a minute and
I’ll go along.”</p>

<p>They left the hall together and walked briskly
toward Main Street. Allan and Hal Smiths had never
been particularly intimate at Hillton, but as they were
the only two fellows from that school in the freshman
class, they had naturally enough felt drawn toward each
other since they had reached Erskine. During the last
week, however, Hal had been making friends fast, and
as a consequence Allan had seen less of him. Hal had
quite a reputation, gained during his last year at Hillton,
as a full-back, and he was generally conceded to
be certain of making the freshman football team, if
not the varsity second. To-night Hal was full of football
matters, and Allan let him talk on uninterruptedly
until they had reached the corner. There:</p>

<p>“Come on down and play some pool,” suggested
Hal.</p>

<p>But Allan shook his head. He liked pool, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a condition in mathematics to work off it behooved him
to do some studying.</p>

<p>“I’ll play some other night,” he said. And then:
“Say, Hal,” he asked, “do you know a chap in our
class named Burley?”</p>

<p>“Pete Burley? Yes; what about him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. What’s he like?”</p>

<p>“Like an elephant,” answered Hal, disgustedly.
“A big brute of a chap from Texas or Montana or
somewhere out that way.” Hal’s ideas of the West
were rather vague. “Met him the other day; struck
me as a big idiot. Well, see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Hal swung off down Main Street and Allan turned
toward his room, feeling quite virtuous for that he
had resisted temptation in the shape of pool and was
going home to toil. When he opened his door a sheet
of paper torn from a blue-book fluttered to the floor.
There was a pin in it and it had evidently been impaled
on the door. Allan held it to the light and saw in big
round, boyish characters the inscription:</p>

<p class="noic">“<span class="smcap">Pete Burley</span>.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>ON THE CINDERS</small></h2>


<p>On the following Monday, Allan set out after his
three-o’clock recitation for Erskine Field. He stopped
at his room long enough to leave his books and get his
mail&mdash;the Sunday letter from home usually put in its
appearance on Monday afternoon&mdash;and then went on
out Poplar Street.</p>

<p>It was a fine, mild afternoon, with the sunlight
sifting down through the branches of the giant elms
which line the way, and a suggestion of Indian summer
in the air. If he hadn’t been so busy with his
letter he could have found plenty to interest him on the
walk to the field, but, as it was, he was deeply concerned
with the news from home.</p>

<p>There was talk, his mother wrote, of closing down
the Gold Beetle mine out in Colorado, from which distant
enterprise the greater part of her income had long
been derived in the shape of dividends on a large
amount of stock; the gold-bearing ore had given out
and the directors were to consider the course to pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at a meeting in December. Meanwhile, his mother
explained, the work had stopped, and so had the dividends,
and she didn’t like to consider what would happen
if this source of income was shut off for all time.
Allan tried to feel regretful over the matter, since his
mother was clearly worried&mdash;more worried than she
was willing to show, had he but known it&mdash;but the
Gold Beetle was a long way off, it always had supplied
them with money, and the idea that it was now to
cease doing so seemed something quite preposterous.
The Gold Beetle represented the family fortune, about
all that remained after his father’s affairs had been
settled.</p>

<p>Allan found other news more to his liking: Dorothy
was getting on nicely at her new boarding-school and
had survived the initial period of tragic homesickness;
one of Allan’s friends at Hillton, now a Yale freshman,
had called at the house a few days before; and Edith
Cinnamon had presented the household with a litter
of three lovely kittens. Edith Cinnamon was the cat,
Allan’s particular pet, and the news of the interesting
event remained in his mind after the reprehensible
conduct of the Gold Beetle mine had departed from it.
Mines stand merely for money, but kittens are pets,
and Allan loved pets. A wonderful idea struck him:
why not have his mother send him one of the kittens?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He resolved to confer with Mrs. Purdy on his return;
surely she would have no objections to his obtaining
a room-mate to share the “parlor study” with him!</p>

<p>When he had changed his clothes for a running
costume in the locker house and reached the track he
found fully half a score of fellows before him. There
was Hooker jogging around the back-stretch; nearer
at hand was Harris practising starts; in a group at
the finish of the hurdles he saw Stearns, the track-team
captain, Rindgely, several fellows whose faces he knew
but whose names were unknown to him, and Billy
Kernahan. He drew aside to let a file of runners by
and then approached the group. Rindgely nodded to
him slightly, not with any suggestion of unfriendliness,
but rather in the manner of one who has never been
properly introduced. Billy accompanied his salutation
with a critical survey of the half-clothed figure confronting
him.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling to-day?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine, thanks!” answered Allan.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy! We’ll try you at three-quarters
of a mile after a while. You’d better get warmed up,
and then try half a dozen starts.”</p>

<p>While the trainer was speaking, Allan was aware
of the fact that Walter Stearns was observing him
with evident interest. When Billy ceased, Stearns said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
something to him in low tones, and the next moment
Allan found himself being introduced to the track-team
captain. Stearns was rather under than above medium
height, with small features and alert eyes of a steel-gray
shade that contrasted oddly with his black hair.
Below his white trunks his legs were thin and muscular,
and under the faded purple sweater his chest proved
itself broad and deep. He spoke rapidly, as though
his tongue had learned the secret of his legs and was
given to dashes rather than to sustained efforts.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Ware,” he said, as he shook
hands. “Glad you’re coming out to help us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll be much help,” answered
Allan.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; bound to. I saw you run in the handicaps.
That was a mighty pretty race you made. By
the way, do you know Mr. Long? And this is Mr.
Monroe. And Mr. Mason. Keep in with Mason. He’s
office-boy on the Purple and writes criticisms of the
track team.”</p>

<p>Allan shook hands with the three, while the group
laughed at Stearns’s fling at the managing editor of
the college weekly. Long was a startlingly tall fellow,
with a crooked nose and twinkling, yellowish eyes, and
Monroe was short and thick-set, and looked ill-tempered.
Mason, Allan recognized as one of a half-dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
men whom he had seen about college and as to whose
identity he had been curious. Mason was the sort of
fellow that attracts attention: tall, broad-shouldered,
with shrewd, kindly eyes behind glasses and a firm
mouth under a straight and sensitive nose. He looked
very much the gentleman, and Allan was glad to make
his acquaintance. He was in the dark as to what position
Mason really occupied on the Purple, and so the
point of Stearns’s joke was lost on him. But he smiled,
nevertheless, having learned that it is sometimes well
to assume knowledge when one hasn’t it.</p>

<p>“See you again,” said Stearns. The others nodded
with various degrees of friendliness and Allan took
himself off. The track was in good condition to-day
and held the spikes firmly. Allan jogged up and down
the stretch a few times, trying his muscles, which on
Saturday had felt a bit stiff after the mile run, and
lifting his knees high. Then he started around the
track. Half-way around he drew up behind Hooker.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the latter. “Nice day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Allan agreed that it was, and the two went on
together to the turn. There Hooker turned up the
straightaway.</p>

<p>“Going to try starts?” he asked. “Let’s go up
to the end there.”</p>

<p>Allan couldn’t see the necessity for becoming proficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the crouching start until Hooker explained
as they returned from a brief dash, in which the
younger lad had been left wofully far behind.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” said Hooker, “you’ll want the pole
at the start, and if you’re placed two or three places
away from it, you won’t get it from a stand, you see.
But if you use the crouch and get away quick, you
have a pretty good show of getting ahead of the men
who have the inside of you. Let’s try it again. You
give the signal this time.”</p>

<p>After ten minutes of it, Allan picked up his sweater
and followed Hooker down the track to report to Kernahan.
The football men had taken possession of the
gridiron by this time, Long and others were practising
at the high jump, and altogether the field looked very
busy.</p>

<p>“You and Ware try three laps,” said the trainer
to Hooker. “Watch your form, now, and never mind
about your time. I’ll attend to that for you. Take
turn about at the pacing; you take the first lap, Hooker.
Want to get into this, Larry?”</p>

<p>Rindgely nodded and peeled off his sweater. The
others had to trot about for a minute or two while
Rindgely stretched his muscles. Then the three got on
to the mark, Billy gave the word, and they started off
at an easy pace, Hooker in the lead, Allan next, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Rindgely in the rear. All three hugged the rim of
the track and settled down into their pace. On the
back-stretch they had to slow down once to avoid a group
of football substitutes who were crossing the cinders,
and once Rindgely was forced to leap over a ball that
came bouncing out onto the track, and was much incensed
about it. Hooker’s pace was wonderfully steady,
but Allan thought it rather slow. At the mark Billy
told them to “hit it up a bit now,” and Hooker slowed
down, letting Allan into the lead.</p>

<p>Allan increased the pace considerably. This time
there were no interruptions, and they neared the end
of the second lap fresh and untired. Kernahan glanced
up from his watch as they sped by.</p>

<p>“All right!” he shouted. “Get up there, Larry,
and hold that pace.”</p>

<p>Rindgely took the lead. As they commenced the
turn Allan’s gaze, wandering a second from the front,
lighted upon a tall, wide-shouldered and somewhat uncouth
figure at the edge of the track. Strange to say,
the figure nodded its head at him and waved a hand,
and as Allan went by there came a stentorian cry of
encouragement that might have been heard half across
the field:</p>

<p>“Chase ’em down, Freshman! Give ’em fits!”</p>

<p>Allan bit his lips angrily as he sped on. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
business had that big chump yelling at him like that
when he didn’t even know him? Pretty fresh, that’s
what it was! Allan hadn’t made the acquaintances of
so many fellows but that he could remember them, and
he was quite sure that he had never met the big chap
who had yelled. But at the same time there had been
something familiar about the fellow’s voice&mdash;too familiar,
thought Allan with a grudging smile&mdash;and he
wondered who he might be and why he had singled
him out for his unwelcome attentions. Then the incident
passed for the time out of his mind, for the last
turn was almost at hand and Rindgely was increasing
the pace.</p>

<p>Allan began to feel it at the turn, and when they
swung into the home-stretch and the pace, instead of
settling down to a steady finish, grew faster and faster,
he came to the unwelcome conclusion that he was not
in the same class with the other two. Rindgely, in
spite of all Allan could do, lengthened the space between
them. Hooker, seeing that Allan was out of it,
passed him fifty yards from the mark and strove to
overhaul the leader. But Rindgely was never headed,
and finished several yards in front of Hooker and at
least thirty ahead of Allan. When they turned and
jogged back to the trainer, the latter was slipping his
watch into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the good of doing that, Larry?” he asked,
disgustedly. “That wasn’t a race.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just wanted to liven it up a bit,” answered
Rindgely, grinning. “What time did I make, Billy?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take you,” answered the trainer, shortly.
“That’s enough for to-day.”</p>

<p>Allan turned away with the others, but Billy called
him back.</p>

<p>“What was the matter?” he asked. “Pace too
hot for you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so; I couldn’t stand that spurt.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was some of Larry’s nonsense; he’d
no business cutting up tricks.” He was silent a moment,
looking across to where the second eleven was
trying vainly to keep the varsity from pushing over her
goal-line. Then, “Ever try the two miles?” he asked.
Allan shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d be any good at it,” he answered.
“Not that I’m any good at the mile, either,”
he added, somewhat discouraged at the outcome of the
trial.</p>

<p>“What’s the best you ever did at the mile?”</p>

<p>“About four minutes forty-five seconds.”</p>

<p>“You did it inside of forty, Friday.”</p>

<p>“I did?” Allan looked his surprise. “Oh, but
I ran a hundred and twenty yards short.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I allowed for that,” answered Billy, quietly.
“Now, look here, Ware; you’ve got it in you all right,
but you don’t make the most of yourself. You let your
feet drag back badly, and you’ve been trying after too
long a stride. You make that shorter by six inches and
you’ll cut off another second after a while. And to-morrow
I’ll show you what I mean about the stride.
There’s plenty of time before the dual meet in the
spring, and by then we’ll have you doing things right.
The only thing is,” he added, thoughtfully, “whether
you wouldn’t do better at the two miles. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” answered Allan, doubtfully,
“but I’d like to try it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s lots of time. The indoor meet in
Boston comes along in February; we’ll have you in
shape for that, and you can go in for the mile and
the two miles. Meanwhile, you’d better come out with
the other men while the decent weather lasts.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I can make the team?” Allan asked,
hopefully.</p>

<p>“Easy; but they don’t take new men on till after
the trials in the spring.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Allan, a trifle disappointed.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that bother you,” advised the trainer.
“You’re as good as on it now. You make the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the fall training, Ware, and keep fit during the
winter. I’d go in for hockey or something. Ever play
hockey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I can’t skate well enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, get plenty of outdoor exercise of some sort
this winter; don’t let the weather keep you indoors.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll remember.” Allan’s gaze wandered
toward the locker building. Half-way across the field
a big figure was ambling toward the gate, hands in
pockets. Allan turned quickly to the trainer. “Do
you know who that fellow is?” Kernahan’s gaze followed
his. After a moment:</p>

<p>“That’s a freshman named Burley. Know him?”</p>

<p>“No; I just wondered who he was,” Allan replied.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to know him,” he muttered,
irritably, as he trotted off to the locker house.</p>

<p>But Fate seldom consults our inclinations.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>HAL HAS AN IDEA</small></h2>


<p>It seemed to Allan during the next few days that
the bulky form of Peter Burley was bent upon haunting
him. On Tuesday morning, in English, he was aware
of Burley’s presence a few rows behind him; when he
looked around, it was to encounter the big fellow’s
smiling regard. There was really nothing offensive in
that smile; it was merely one of intense friendliness,
quite unconventional in its intensity, but it irritated
Allan greatly. Why couldn’t Burley let him alone?
Just because he had kept him from falling and lugged
him to the dressing-tent, he seemed to have an idea
that Allan was his especial property. And then the
cheek of scrawling his silly name on a fellow’s door!
And yelling like a three-ply idiot at the track!</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that Burley, whoever and whatever
he was, was markedly popular rather increased
Allan’s prejudice. Wherever Burley sat in class there
was invariably a good deal of subdued noise and laughter,
and when he left the hall it was always as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
center of a small circle of fellows, above which Burley
towered head and shoulders. Secretly, Allan envied
Burley’s success with his fellows, but in conversation
with Smiths he dubbed Burley a mountebank. Hal
was visibly impressed with the word and used it unflaggingly
the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Burley was again on the field, but this
time he made no remarks as Allan passed him on the
track; merely smiled and nodded with his offensive
familiarity and then turned his attention to the football
practise. As usual, he was the center of a group,
and after Allan had passed the turn he heard their
laughter and wondered if Burley had selected him as
a butt for his silly jokes. After that Allan saw him
at least once a day until on the following Wednesday
night, when the freshman election took place in Grace
Hall, and Burley leaped into even greater, and to Allan
more offensive, prominence.</p>

<p>There were two leading candidates for the presidency,
and, contrary to the usual custom, the opposing
forces had failed to arrange a compromise and a distribution
of offices. The contest was prolonged and exciting.
On the ninth ballot, Mordaunt, a St. Mathias
fellow, won amidst the howls of the opposition. The
rival candidate was elected secretary, but promptly and
somewhat heatedly declined. New nominations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
called for, and Burley was proposed simultaneously
from two sides of the room. His name met with loud
applause. Burley, sitting unconcernedly near the door,
grinned his appreciation of the joke. Two other names
were offered, and then the balloting began. On the
first ballot, Peter Burley, of Blackwater, Col., was
elected.</p>

<p>Burley tried to get on to his feet to refuse the
honor, but owing to the fact that three companions held
him down while the chairman rapped wildly for order,
he failed to gain recognition. The next moment the
election was made unanimous. Allan grunted his disapproval.
Hal said it didn’t much matter who was
secretary; anybody could be that.</p>

<p>Hal accompanied Allan back to the latter’s room
and stayed until late, talking most of the time about
his chances of making the varsity squad, what he was
going to do if he didn’t, and how he didn’t give a rap
anyway.</p>

<p>“Of course, I can make the freshman team all
right, but what’s that? They have only four outside
games scheduled, and two of those don’t amount to anything;
just high schools. The only game they go away
for is the one with Dexter. And this thing of working
hard for a month to play the Robinson freshmen isn’t
what it’s cracked up to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who will win?” asked Allan, suppressing a
yawn.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble. It’s more’n likely that Robinson
will. We’ve got a lot of good men&mdash;fast backs
and a mighty brainy little quarter&mdash;but we haven’t got
any support for our center. Cheesman’s a wonder, but
he can’t do much with guards like Murray and Kirk
beside him. Why, Kirk doesn’t weigh a hundred and
seventy, and Murray’s only a hundred and eighty-something.
Poor is going to issue another call for candidates;
he’s going to ask every man of a hundred and
seventy-five or over to come out. Say!”</p>

<p>Hal sat up suddenly in the Morris chair and looked
like a Great Discoverer.</p>

<p>“Say what?” murmured Allan, drowsily.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that man Burley?”</p>

<p>“A good deal, I should say, if you ask me,” answered
Allan.</p>

<p>“I mean for a guard,” said Smiths, impatiently.</p>

<p>“He probably never saw a football,” objected
Allan. “They don’t play it out West, do they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t they, though! Look at Michigan and Wisconsin
and&mdash;and the rest of them!”</p>

<p>“I refuse.”</p>

<p>“Why, Burley’s just the man! He must weigh
two hundred if he weighs a pound!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks as though he might weigh a ton. But if
he doesn’t know the game&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How do you know he doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. But if he did know it, wouldn’t he have
been out before this?”</p>

<p>Smiths was silenced for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, even if he doesn’t know it, he can be taught,
I guess. And we’ve got a whole lot of science now;
what we need is beef.”</p>

<p>“Burley looks more like an ass than a cow,” said
Allan, disagreeably. Smiths stared.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s he done to you, anyway? You seem
to be beastly sore on him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you what he’s done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! Besides, he lugged you off the track;
that’s nothing to get mad about, is it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not; I’m not mad about that&mdash;or anything
else. He just&mdash;just makes me tired.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet he’s our man.” Smiths jumped up
and seized his cap. “I’ll run over and tell Poor.”</p>

<p>“What, at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! it’s only eleven-thirty. He’ll be glad to
know about it.”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably pitch you down-stairs, and serve
you right.”</p>

<p>“Not much he won’t. Good night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good night,” answered Allan. “I’ve got some
surgeon’s plaster, if you need it.”</p>

<p>Hal Smiths slammed the door and took the front
porch in one leap. Then the gate crashed. Allan listened
intently.</p>

<p>“That’s funny!” he muttered. “He must have
missed the lamp-post!”</p>

<p>He took up a book, found a pencil, and opened the
table-drawer in search of a pad. As he did so, his eyes
fell on a folded sheet of lined paper. He read the
penciled words on it&mdash;“Peter Burley”&mdash;and, refolding
it after a moment of indecision, tucked it back in
a corner of the drawer, frowning deeply the while.</p>

<p>Allan didn’t see Hal the next day; neither was
the objectionable Burley visible on the field in the
afternoon when Allan ran his first practise over the
mile. Kernahan didn’t hold the watch on him, the
distance was unfamiliar to him, and he lost all idea
of his time after the fourth lap, and ended pretty well
tuckered out.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the trainer, when it was over.
“You ran it a bit too fast at the start. But you’ll get
onto it after a while.”</p>

<p>On Friday Allan saw Hal only for an instant and
had no chance to question him as to the result of his
midnight visit to the freshman football captain. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it was not until Saturday that he learned
of Burley’s appearance on the field as a candidate for
admission into the freshman team. There was no track
work that afternoon, since the Erskine varsity played
State University. Allan went out to the field alone and
watched the game from the season-ticket holders’ stand,
and cheered quite madly when the Erskine quarter-back,
availing himself for the first time of the new
rules, seemed to pass the ball to a trio of plunging
backs, and after an instant of delay set off almost
alone around State’s left end with the pigskin cuddled
in his arm, and flew down the field for over seventy
yards to a touch-down.</p>

<p>That settled the score for the first half, and the
teams trotted off with honors even. There was a good
deal of dissatisfaction expressed in Allan’s neighborhood
over the playing of the home team, and much
gloomy prophecy was indulged in in regard to the
outcome of the final and most important game of the
season&mdash;that with Erskine’s old-time rival, Robinson
University.</p>

<p>About the middle of the intermission, Allan heard
his name called, and looked down to see a small, sandy-haired
fellow waving a note-book at him. Allan waved
back, and the owner of the note-book&mdash;the latter his
never-absent badge of office&mdash;climbed up the seats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was duly pummeled and laid hold of on his way.
Tommy Sweet was a Hillton fellow, and considering
that he had been a class ahead of Allan at that school,
the two had been quite friendly there until Sweet had
gone up to Erskine. So far Allan had not seen much
of him, for Tommy was “on the Purple,” as he liked
to put it, and was an extremely busy youth. Tommy’s
friends declared he would find something to do if he
was strapped in bed.</p>

<p>The key-note of Tommy was eagerness. His wide-open
blue eyes were always staring about the world in
search for something to engage his attention, and his
ridiculously small mouth was forever pursed into something
between a grin and an exclamation-point. His
hair was just the color of tow, and the freckles which
covered every available portion of his face were several
shades darker, but harmonized perfectly. He was tireless
in the search for news for the Purple, and when it
came to activity would have made the proverbial ant
or beaver look like a sluggard. Tommy thought sleep
a criminal waste of time, and even begrudged the moments
spent in eating.</p>

<p>Tommy was only perfectly happy when doing four
things at once; less than four left him dull and dissatisfied.
Clarke Mason once said: “I’ll bet some day
Tommy will commit second-degree murder so they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
give him hard labor for life.” For the rest he was a
cheerful, likable fellow, aggressively honest and painfully
conscientious.</p>

<p>“What did you think of that run of Cutler’s?” he
asked, breathlessly, as he sank onto the seat at Allan’s
side. “Peach, wasn’t it? It’ll show up great in the
diagram I’m making; see!” He opened his note-book
and exhibited a puzzling maze of lines and dots, figures
and letters. “That’s the first half. Everything’s
there&mdash;runs, kicks, plunges, penalties, the whole show.”</p>

<p>“What’s it for?” asked Allan. “Anything to do
with geometry?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; it’s&mdash; Oh, quit your kidding! It’s to
go with my report of the game. It shows how the
gains were made and who made ’em. And I’ve introduced
something new in diagrams, too. See these figures
along the edge here&mdash;4:17, 4:22, and so on?”</p>

<p>“Well, I see something there, I think,” answered
Allan, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Those signify the time each play was made,” said
Tommy, triumphantly. “That’s never been done before,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I see. But it must keep you pretty busy. Do
you have to write the game up, too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” Tommy showed three or four pages
of awful-looking scrawls from a fountain-pen. “That’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
done in a sort of shorthand, and I write it out full
length at the office. Say, where did you tell me your
room was? I meant to put it down, but forgot it.
Purdy’s? Oh, yes; I know where that is. I want to
come around some evening, if I can ever find the time.
How are you getting on? Anything I can do for you?
Any fellows you’d like to meet? No? Well, let me
know if I can do anything for you. Very glad to,
you know. That was quite a race you made the other
day. Billy seems to have taken a fancy to you, doesn’t
he? He’s all right, Allan; you shine up to him and&mdash;
Hello! there’s a fellow I want to see. Come and see
me, will you? Twenty-two Sesson, you know. So long,
old chap!”</p>

<p>Tommy hurried pell-mell down the stand, shaking
off detaining hands, and disappeared into the throng.
Allan took a long breath; he felt as though a small
hurricane had been playing with him. The teams came
onto the field again and the second half began. It
proved uninteresting, and only the superior weight of
the Erskine eleven won them the game finally by the
close margin of a safety. Allan followed the throng out
of the enclosure and across toward the locker house and
the gate. But half-way there the crowd divided, and
Allan presently found himself looking on at the practise
of the freshman teams. The first team had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ball on the second’s five-yard line and was trying very
hard to put it over to an accompaniment of command
and entreaty from the coaches.</p>

<p>“Third down and two to go!” some one shouted.
A shrill voice called a jumble of figures and a tandem
slid forward at a tangent, and for an instant confusion
reigned. Then suddenly a roar of laughter went up,
the line of watchers broke forward, and Allan found
himself directly in the path of what at first glance
looked like an avalanche of canvas and leather. Springing
back, he escaped being borne along by the group
of struggling players, in the center of which, rising like
a city sky-scraper out of a huddle of shanties, stood
forth, calm and determined, the countenance of Peter
Burley.</p>

<p>In his arms, struggling but helpless, was the first
eleven’s left half-back, and to his back and legs and,
in short, to every portion of his anatomy, hung the
enemy, for all the world like bees on a nest in swarming
time. Behind them the second eleven pushed and
shoved, and relentlessly the whole mass moved down
the field. And somewhere, drowned by the laughter
of the spectators and the despairing shrieks of “Down!
Down!” from the abducted half-back, sounded feebly
the referee’s whistle.</p>

<p>One by one the impeditive players dropped away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and Burley’s triumphant advance toward the enemy’s
goal was stopped by the referee and two coaches. Burley
set down the half-back, in whose arms the pigskin
was still clutched, but did not release his grasp until
his obligations were hurriedly but clearly explained to
him. Then he patted the half-back on the shoulder
in a paternal manner and retraced his steps to the enthusiastic
applause of the convulsed throng. The second
team hugged as much of him as they could encompass
and he smiled cheerfully, but was evidently still
somewhat perplexed. The ball went to the second on
her eight yards and the game continued, Burley, at
right guard, looming head and shoulders above his
companions.</p>

<p>Allan watched the game for a few moments longer,
and then continued his journey. Somehow the calm,
inscrutable manner in which the big freshman had
strode down the field in unquestioning obedience to
what he had supposed to be his duty appealed to Allan.
It had been awfully funny, and Allan smiled as he
recalled it. But the incident had held for him something
more than humor, just what he hardly knew; but
whatever it was, and even though he would have found
it difficult to give a name to it, it completely changed
his feeling toward Burley. By the time he had reached
Mrs. Purdy’s front gate, he was wondering whether
Burley still desired his acquaintance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>“MR. PETER BURLEY, BLACKWATER, COL.”</small></h2>


<p>Hal Smiths dropped in after dinner that evening
and Allan brought the conversation around to the subject
of Burley, whose performance during practise had
been the chief topic at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>“Why, Poor was awfully pleased at my suggestion,”
said Hal, “after I found him. It was after twelve
then, and I’d chased half over college looking for him.
He said he wasn’t very good at persuasion and thought
Burley would require lots of it; so he asked me to see
him. Poor’s a pretty good little chap, so I went. Burley
was awfully decent. Said he had never played and
had never even seen the game until he came here; said
he hadn’t been able to find out what it was all about, but
that if we wanted him to try it, why, of course, he
would. Said he thought it looked like pretty good fun,
and got me to sort of explain it a bit. One thing he
wanted to know,” laughed Hal, “was whether you could
hit a man if he didn’t have the ball.”</p>

<p>“Well, he played it for all it was worth this afternoon,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said Allan, smiling. “You heard about it,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; what was it? I sat on the side line all afternoon,
and waited to get a whack at State University.
What did Burley do?”</p>

<p>So Allan told him, and Hal laughed until the tears
came.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a genius, he is!” he said.</p>

<p>After a minute of chuckling, he went on:</p>

<p>“Look here, Allan, I think you’d rather like him
if you got to know him. He’s&mdash;he’s rather a decent
sort, after all. I didn’t take to him at first, of course,
but&mdash;and I don’t say now that he’s the sort of chap
you’d want to ask home and introduce to your people;
he’s kind of free and easy, and you couldn’t be sure
he wouldn’t drink the catsup out of the bottle or slap
your governor on the back&mdash;but he’s&mdash;well, there’s something
about him you can’t help liking,” he ended, with
an apologetic tone.</p>

<p>“Maybe I would,” answered Allan, pleasantly. Hal
looked surprised.</p>

<p>“He’s given up the class secretaryship, you know,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know for sure, but Poor says he told him
it was because he didn’t think he’d be here much after
the holidays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s he going?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Funny idea, to come to college for
half a year. Maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There were footsteps on the porch, the front portal
opened with a crash, and an imperative knock sounded
on the room door. Allan jumped to his feet. Could
it be fire? he wondered, shooting a bewildered glance
at Hal. He hurried to the door just as the hammering
began again, more violently than before. Hal raised
himself uneasily from the Morris chair, prepared for
the worst. Allan called, “<em>Come in!</em>” and the door
was flung open.</p>

<p>Entered Tommy Sweet!</p>

<p>“You thundering idiot!” bawled Hal. “I thought
it was at least the Dean! You can make more&mdash;
Hello, Burley! Glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Burley, Allan,” Tommy was saying.
“Brought him around ’cause I wanted you to know
each other. Mr. Ware&mdash;Mr. Burley.”</p>

<p>Allan felt his hand enveloped in something large
and warm and vise-like. He felt his fingers crushed
together, thought he could hear the bones breaking&mdash;and
still managed to smile painfully, but politely, the
while. Then Burley had dropped his hand and was
saying:</p>

<p>“I’ve wanted to know you ever since I saw you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
win that running race the other day. Came around
here and left a card on you, but I guess you didn’t
find it.”</p>

<p>Allan murmured his appreciation, but remained
silent as to the “card.”</p>

<p>“I told Sweet here that you’d win that race. Offered
to bet him anything he liked. He wouldn’t bet,
though.” Peter Burley took the chair proffered by Hal
and carefully lowered himself into it.</p>

<p>“They told me you carried me over to the tent,”
said Allan. “Much obliged, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Welcome,” answered the other, heartily. “You
didn’t weigh anything to mention.”</p>

<p>“Not as heavy as the freshman team, eh?” asked
Tommy. Burley looked apologetically around the
circle.</p>

<p>“I suppose every one’s heard of that fool thing?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Just about every one, I guess,” laughed Tommy.</p>

<p>“That comes of trying to do something you don’t
know how to do. This fellow Smiths here came around
to my shack the other day and said the class wanted
me to play football because I weigh some. Well, ginger!
I didn’t know anything about the thing, and
I told him so. But he would have it that I must play.
And look what happens! I make a measly show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
myself right out there on the range in front of the
whole outfit!”</p>

<p>“No harm done,” said Hal. “You did what you
tried to.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. There was a little cuss there in a
Derby hat wouldn’t let me. I was going to take that
half-backed fellow down to the other end and throw
him over the line. That’s what I was going to do.
They didn’t tell me I had to slap him on the chest and
butt him with my head.”</p>

<p>“But, you see,” explained Allan, “he called
‘Down’ just when you began to lug him off.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they said. I was supposed to let go
of him when he said that, but I just thought he was
throwing up the sponge and wanted me to let him down.
If I’d known he could have spoiled it by yelling ‘Down,’
I’d have held his mouth shut.”</p>

<p>This summoned laughter, and Burley glanced
around at the others in wide surprise. Allan felt surprise,
too. Was Burley really quite so unsophisticated
as he seemed, he wondered, or&mdash; His glance met Burley’s.
The big fellow’s right eyelid dropped slowly in
a portentous wink. Allan smiled. His question was
answered. While the others entered into an explanation
and discussion of the rules and ethics of football,
Allan studied the Westerner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter Burley looked to be, and was, twenty years
of age. In form he was remarkably large; he was an
inch over six feet tall, and weighed 203 pounds. Nowhere
about him was there evidence of unnecessary fat,
but he was deep of chest and wide of shoulder and
hips. His hands and feet were large, and the latter
were encased in enormously heavy shoes.</p>

<p>When it came to features, Burley was undeniably
good-looking in a certain breezy, unconventional way.
(Allan soon found that Burley’s breeziness and absence
of convention were not confined to his looks.) Burley’s
hair was brown, of no particular shade, and his eyes
matched his hair. His nose was big and straight and
his mouth well shaped. His cheeks were deeply tanned,
but showed little color beneath. His usual expression
was one of careless, whimsical good nature, but there
was an earnest and kindly gleam in the brown eyes that
lent character to the face. He talked with a drawl,
and pronounced many words in a way quite novel to
Allan. But&mdash;and this Allan discovered later&mdash;when
occasion required, he was capable of delivering his remarks
in a sharp, incisive way that made the words
sound like rifle-shots. At the present moment he was
talking with almost exaggerated deliberateness.</p>

<p>“Sweet says you and he went to a preparatory school
together,” he said, turning to Allan. “I wish my old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
man had sent me to one of those things. What was
your school like?”</p>

<p>Allan told him of Hillton, and Tommy and Hal
chimed in from time to time and helped him along.
It was a large subject and one they liked, and half an
hour passed before they had finished. Burley listened
with evident interest, and only interrupted occasionally
to ask a question.</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to come to Erskine?” asked
Tommy, when the subject had been exhausted. Burley
took one big knee into his hands and considered the
question for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” he said at last. “You see, I
had a go at the university over in Boulder; that’s near
Denver,” he explained, parenthetically. “But we
didn’t get on very well together, the faculty and me,
and I was always turning up at the ranch. Well, the
old man got tired of seeing me around so much; said
he’d paid for my keep at the university, and I’d ought
to stay there and get even with the game. But, ginger!
the corral wasn’t big enough. Every time I’d try to
be good, something would come along and happen, and&mdash;first
thing I knew, I’d be roaming at large again.
So the old man said he guessed what I needed was
to get far enough away from home so I wouldn’t back-trail
so often; said there wasn’t much doing when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
went to college Monday morning and showed up for
feed Thursday night. First he tried taking my railroad
pass away; but when I couldn’t scare up the money,
I rode home on a freight. I got to know the train
crews on the D. &amp; R. G. pretty well long toward spring.
When vacation came, we all agreed to call it off&mdash;the
faculty and the old man and me. So I went up to
Rico and fooled around a mine there all summer.
When&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What was the name of the mine?” asked Allan,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“This one was the Indian Girl. There’s lots of
’em thereabouts. The old man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, is the ‘old man’ your father?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes; why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only I should think he’d lick you if he
heard you calling him that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t mind. Besides, he isn’t really old;
only about forty. He calls me Kid, too,” he added,
smiling broadly. “Well, in the summer he wanted to
know where I’d rather go to college&mdash;Yale, Harvard,
Princeton, Pennsylvania; he said he didn’t care so long
as it was far enough away to keep me from diggin’ out
for home every week and presenting myself with vacations
not down on the calendar. Well, there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fellow up at the mine named Thompson; he was superintendent.
I was helping him&mdash;or thought I was&mdash;and
so we got to be pretty good friends. He was a nice
little fellow, about as high as a sage-bush, and as plucky
as a bulldog. Well, he went to college here about ten
years ago, and he used to tell me a good deal about the
place. So, when the old man said, ‘Which is it?’ I
told him Erskine. He said he’d never heard tell of it,
but so long as it was about two thousand miles from
Blackwater he guessed it would do. And that’s how.
Now you talk.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first time I ever heard of choosing a
college because it was a long way from home,” laughed
Hal. “I’d like to meet that father of yours.”</p>

<p>“Better go back with me Christmas,” said Burley.
Hal stared at him doubtfully, undecided whether to
laugh or not. “Of course,” continued Burley, carelessly,
“we haven’t got much out there. It’s pretty
much all alfalfa and sage-bush around Blackwater. But
the hills aren’t far, and there’s good hunting up toward
Routt. You fellows all better come; the old man would
be pleased to have you.”</p>

<p>Hal stared wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you fooling?” he gasped.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">“Fooling?” Burley echoed. “Why, no, I ain’t
fooling.</a> What’s wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing; but of course we couldn’t do it, you
know; at least, I’m plumb sure I couldn’t.” Hal
looked doubtfully at the others.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Allan. “I only wish I could.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Tommy, wistfully. “I’d give
a heap to have the chance.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” answered Burley. “Perhaps in the summer,
or some other time, when you haven’t got anything
better. I suppose your folks want you at home
Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” replied Hal, “but it isn’t altogether that;
there’s the expense, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wouldn’t cost you anything much,” said
Burley. “It’s all on me. You’d better say you’ll
come.”</p>

<p>Hal’s eyes opened wider than before.</p>

<p>“You mean you’d pay our fares&mdash;all our fares&mdash;out
to Colorado and back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. We’d only have about a week out there,
but we could do a lot of damage in a week.”</p>

<p>Hal was silent from amazement. Allan stammered
his thanks. Tommy merely sat and stared at Burley,
as though fascinated. The latter translated silence into
assent.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll call it fixed, eh?” he asked, heartily.</p>

<p>“Thunder, no!” exploded Hal. “We couldn’t do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that, Burley. We’re awfully much obliged, but, of
course, if we went out there to visit you, we’d pay our
own way. And I don’t believe any of us could do that&mdash;this
Christmas, at least.”</p>

<p>“Oh, be good!” said Burley. “Now, look here;
I’d let you do that much for me.”</p>

<p>“But we couldn’t,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“Well, you would if you could, of course; wouldn’t
you, now?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;I suppose we would,” Allan faltered.</p>

<p>“Well, there you are!” said Burley, triumphantly.
“That settles it.”</p>

<p>It took the others some time to prove to him that
it didn’t settle it, and Burley listened with polite, but
disapproving, attention. When the argument was concluded,
he shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“You’re a lot of Indians!” he said. “You’re not
doing the square thing by me, and I’m going to pull
my freight.” He drew himself out of the chair and
rescued his big felt hat from beneath it. There was
a general pushing back of chairs. “You and Mr. Ware
must come around to my tepee some night soon,” Burley
told Hal, “and we’ll have another pow-wow. Seems
like I’d done all the chinning to-night.” He shook
hands with Allan, who strove to bear the pain with
fortitude and only grimaced once, and said in quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
matter-of-fact way, “I guess you and I are going to
be partners. Good night.”</p>

<p>Allan muttered that he hoped so, and after the three
visitors had taken their departures he examined his
hand under the light to see if bruises or dislocations
were visible.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he asked himself, with a rueful smile,
“if he shakes hands very often with his partners?”</p>

<small>“RIGHT GUARD BACK!”</small></h2>


<p>November started in with an Indian summer, but
by the middle of the month the spell had broken, and
a week of hard, driving rain succeeded the bright
weather. Until then Allan had spent almost every
afternoon on the cinder-track, running the half mile
at good speed, doing the mile and a half inside his
time, occasionally practising sprinting, and, once a
week, jogging around until he had left nine laps behind
him and had covered a quarter of a mile over
his distance.</p>

<p>For by this time Kernahan had decided that the
two-mile event was what he was cut out for, but promised
him, nevertheless, that at the indoor athletic meeting,
in February, he should be allowed to try both the
mile and the two miles. The trainer’s instruction had
already bettered Allan’s form; his stride had lost in
length and gained in speed and grace until it became
a subject for admiring comment among the fellows.</p>

<p>The Purple, in an article on Fall Work of the Track
Team Candidates, hailed “Ware ’07” as “a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
promising runner, and one who has improved rapidly
in form since the Fall Handicaps until at present he
easily leads the distance men in that feature. It is
Mr. Kernahan’s intention,” concluded the Purple, “to
develop Ware as a two-miler, since this year, as in
several years past, there is a dearth of first-class material
for this distance.”</p>

<p>But the rains put an end to the track work, as they
put an end to all outdoor activities save football, and
training was practically dropped by the candidates. On
three occasions, when the clouds temporarily ceased
emptying themselves onto a sodden earth, the middle
and long distance candidates were sent on cross-country
jogs and straggled home at dusk, very wet and muddy,
and much out of temper. A week before Thanksgiving
the sky became less gloomy and a sharp frost froze the
earth till it rang like metal underfoot.</p>

<p>It was on one such day, a Saturday, that the Robinson
freshman football team came to town and, headed
by a brass band, marched out to the field to do battle
with the Erskine youngsters. The varsity team had
journeyed from home to play Artmouth, and consequently
the freshman contest drew the entire college
and town, and enthusiasm reigned supreme in spite of
the fact that a Robinson victory was acknowledged to
be a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Allan and Tommy Sweet watched the game from
the side lines; Tommy, with note-book in hand, darting
hither and thither from one point of vantage to another,
and Allan vainly striving to keep up with him.
The latter had gained admission beyond the ropes by
posing as Tommy’s assistant; the assistance rendered
consisted principally of listening to Tommy’s breathless
comment on the game.</p>

<p>“Oh, rotten!” Tommy would snarl. “Two yards
more!... Oh; perfectly rotten!... See that pass?
See it? What? Eh, what?... Now, watch this!
Watch&mdash; What’d I say? Good work, Seven!...
Now, that’s playing!... Third down and one to&mdash;
What’s that? Lost it? Lost nothing! Why, look
where the ball is! How can they have lost&mdash; Hey!
how’s that for off-side? Just watch that Robinson left
end; look! See that?... Three yards right through
the center! What was Burley doing?... Well, here
goes for a touch-down. There’s no help now!...
Another yard!... Two more!... Did they make
it? Did they?... <em>Hi-i-i! Our ball!</em>”</p>

<p>It was a very pretty game, after all, and when the
first half ended with the score only 5 to 0, in the visitors’
favor, Erskine’s hope revived, and during the intermission
there was much talk of tying the score, while
some few extremely optimistic watchers hinted at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Erskine victory. Considering the fact that the purple-clad
team was twelve pounds lighter than its opponent,
this was a good deal to expect, and Tommy, a fair
example of conservative opinion, declared that the best
he looked for was to have the second half end with the
score as it then stood. But a good many guesses went
wrong that afternoon.</p>

<p>Erskine had played on the defensive during the first
half, and when, after receiving Robinson’s kick-off, she
punted the ball without trying to run it back, it seemed
that she was continuing her former tactics. The punt
was a good one and was caught on Robinson’s thirty-yard
line. The Brown accepted the challenge and returned
the kick. It went to Erskine’s forty-five yards.
Again Poor punted, and the ball sailed down to the
Brown’s fifteen yards, where it was gathered into a
half-back’s arms. Erskine had gained largely in the
two exchanges of punts, and her supporters cheered
loudly, while Robinson, realizing discretion to be the
better part of valor, refrained from further kicking
and ran the ball back ten yards before she was downed.</p>

<p>And then, as in the first period of play, she began
to advance the pigskin by fierce plunges at the Erskine
line. But now there was a perceptible difference in
results, a difference recognized by the spectators after
the first two attacks. Robinson wasn’t making much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
headway. Twice she barely made her distance; the
third time she failed by six inches and, amidst cheering
plainly heard on the campus, Erskine took the ball on
her opponent’s twenty-five yards. The first plunge
netted a bare yard, yet it carried the ball out of the
checker-board, and a line-man dropped back. Tommy
set up a shout.</p>

<p>“It’s Burley! They’re going to play him back of
the line!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it’s being Burley. He
loomed far above the rest of the backs, and even when,
his hands on the full-back’s hips, he doubled himself
up for the charge, he was still the biggest object on
the field. The stands danced with delight.</p>

<p>So far there had been no hint of the big right guard
taking part in the tandem attacks; in fact, his presence
on the team was doubtful until the last moment, for
Burley’s development as a football player had been
discouragingly slow, in spite of his weight and strength
and cheerful willingness. Even yet he possessed only
a partial understanding of the game. He did what
he was told to do, and did it as hard as he knew how;
that constituted the extent of his science. The stands
composed themselves, and breathless suspense reigned.
Poor’s shrill pipe was heard reeling off the signals, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the advance began.</p>

<p>Robinson had played hard every moment of the
first thirty-five minutes, and she had played on the
offensive. Erskine had played hard too, but her playing
had been defensive. To attack is more tiring than
to repel attack, and now what difference there was in
condition was in Erskine’s favor. Her defensive tactics
were suddenly abandoned, and from that moment
to the final whistle she forced the fighting every instant
of the time.</p>

<p>Peter Burley was, to use Tommy’s broken, breathless
words, “simply great.” He knew little or nothing
about line-plunging. He didn’t do any of the things
coaches instruct backs to do. He merely waded into
and through the opponents, without bothering his head
with the niceties of play. If the hole was there, well
and good; he went through it and emerged on the other
side with half the Robinson team clinging to him. If
the hole wasn’t there, well and good again; he went
through just the same, only he didn’t go so far. But
there was always a good gain&mdash;sometimes a yard, sometimes
two, sometimes three or four.</p>

<p>When the whistle blew, Burley climbed to his feet
and ambled back to his position, unruffled and unheeding
of the bruises that fell to his share. Nine plunges
brought the ball to Robinson’s five yards. There the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Brown line held for an instant. The first down netted
a bare yard, the second brought scarcely as much. The
cheering, which had been continuous from the first
attack, died down, and a great silence fell. Tommy
was nibbling the corner off his note-book, and Allan,
kneeling beside him, was nervously biting his lip.
Poor drew Burley and the backs aside for a whispered
consultation. Then the players took their positions
again, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Presto! Erskine had scored!</p>

<p>Without signals, the tandem had plunged onto the
Robinson left tackle, Burley’s leather head-guard had
been seen for an instant tossing high above a struggling
mass, and then had disappeared, and chaos had reigned
until the referee’s whistle commanded a cessation of
hostilities. When the piled-up mass was removed,
Burley was found serenely hugging the ball to his chest
a yard over the line.</p>

<p>While the stands cavorted and cheered, Poor kicked
the goal. Erskine was already victorious, and Robinson’s
youngsters seemed to realize the fact. For,
though they fought valiantly and doggedly for twenty
minutes longer, it was evident that they no longer
looked for victory. With every repulse their defense
grew perceptibly weaker, while their rivals, as though
they had husbanded their strength until now, made each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
attack fiercer than the one before, until in the last ten
minutes of the contest they simply drove the Brown
before them at will. Long before the game was at an
end the stands began to empty; there was small pleasure
in seeing a defeated enemy humbled. When the final
whistle blew, the score stood 17 to 5, and Peter Burley,
breathing hard through bleeding and swollen lips, said
“he guessed he was ready to have his oats and be bedded
down.”</p>

<p>It is human nature to dwell at length upon our
successes and dismiss our failures with a word. The
writer has given a chapter to the freshman game, but
he is going to tell the story of the varsity contest, which
occurred a week later, in a paragraph.</p>

<p>Robinson won in a clean, hard-fought game&mdash;11
to 0. Her rival never approached a score in either
half, but by the grimmest sort of defensive work she
managed to keep the final figures down to half of what
they might have been had she gone to pieces for an
instant. Hal played a brilliant game at full-back in
that contest, and proved his right to the position. Thus
the football season at Erskine ended in decisive defeat.
It was an honorable defeat, to be sure; but, since at
Erskine, as at other colleges in this country, they play
more for the sake of winning than for love of the
game, there were doleful faces a-plenty, and on Sunday
the college had the appearance of a place smitten with
the plague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>But Monday morning came and brought recitations
and lectures, just as though there was no such thing
as football, and the college settled back into the usual
routine. At noon the sting of defeat was forgotten.
At night, fellows were cheerfully discussing the chances
for the next year. If we take defeat too hard, at least
we recover quickly; there is hope for us in that.</p>

<p>Allan, for all that he was quite as patriotic as any,
felt the defeat of the varsity team less than he did the
cessation of track work. The latter left him at first
feeling like a fish out of water. Tommy Sweet suggested
that he might rig up a treadmill in his room
and run to his heart’s content, like a squirrel in a wire
cage. But Tommy wouldn’t promise to feed him all
the peanuts he could eat, and so Allan refused to try
the scheme. Instead, he spent much of his time out-of-doors
and took long walks and runs out along the
river or struck off westward to Millport.</p>

<p>On many of these excursions he was accompanied
by Peter Burley. Peter&mdash;or more properly Pete, since
that was the name he declared to be the proper one&mdash;Pete
couldn’t be persuaded to do any running, but he
was willing to walk any distance and in any direction,
seeming to care very little whether he ever got back
to Centerport or didn’t. And as his long legs took him
over the ground about as fast as Allan could jog, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
latter never suffered for want of exercise while in Pete’s
company.</p>

<p>The friendship between the two had grown rapidly,
until now Pete’s prophecy that they were to be “partners”
had come true. The more Allan saw of the older
boy the more he found to like, but just what the qualities
were which drew him to Pete he would have found
it hard to tell. The latter’s never-failing good-nature
was undoubtedly one of them, but that alone was not
accountable. Perhaps Pete would have experienced
quite as much difficulty had he been called upon to say
why he had been attracted by Allan the first time he
had seen him, or why he had perseveringly sought his
friendship ever since. The two were radically dissimilar,
but even that isn’t sufficient to explain why each
was attracted toward the other. Come to think of it,
however, I don’t believe either Allan or Pete troubled
himself about the problem, and so why should we?</p>

<p>Pete’s sudden leap into fame consequent upon his
work against Robinson in the freshman game had left
him unaffected. He had become a college hero in an
hour, but none could see that it ever made any difference
to him. He brushed congratulation aside good-naturedly
and ridiculed praise.</p>

<p>“Stop your fool talk!” he would say. “I didn’t
rope any steers. It was that little jack-rabbit, Poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that whooped things up and won the game. I didn’t
do a thing but shove ’em round some.” And when it
was hinted that the shoving around was what brought
victory, “Get out!” he would growl. “Science is what
does the business, and I don’t know the first thing about
the game.”</p>

<p>And so, while Peter was worshiped by the freshman
class and very generally respected by the others,
he wasn’t at all the popular conception of a college hero.
And there were three fellows, at least, who liked him
all the better for it.</p>

<p>Those three were Allan, Tommy, and Hal. Since
that first meeting in Allan’s room, the four had been
much together. Tommy showed up at the gatherings
less frequently than any one of the others, for Tommy,
in his own words, “had a lot of mighty difficult stunts
to do.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the quartet met in Allan’s room, sometimes
in Hal’s, less frequently in Tommy’s&mdash;for Tommy
lived up two flights of stairs in McLean Hall, and
Pete had a horror of climbing stairs. The only climbing
he liked, he said, was climbing into a saddle. That
was why he often found fault with his own apartments.</p>

<p>These were on the second floor of a plain clap-boarded
building at the corner of Town Lane and
Center Street, with the railroad but a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
feet distant and the fire-house next door. Pete declared
he liked the noise, and could never study so well
as when the switch-engine was shunting cars to and
fro at the end of the lane or the fire-bell was clanging
an infrequent alarm. As few ever saw him studying,
the statement sounded plausible.</p>

<p>The ground floor of the building was occupied by a
dealer in harness and leather; the third floor consisted
of an empty loft. Across the lane&mdash;and the lane wasn’t
wide enough to boast of&mdash;was a livery stable. On the
opposite corner was a carriage repair-shop and warehouse.
A few doors below was a wheelwright’s. The
upper floors of the neighboring structures were occupied
by carpenters, plumbers, roofers, and masons.</p>

<p>Through Pete’s windows, which were invariably
open, be the weather what it might, floated in a strange
and penetrating aroma&mdash;a mingled bouquet of coal-smoke
from the railroad, of the odor of pine-shavings
from the carpenter shops, of the pungent smell of
leather from below, and of the fragrance from the stable
across the street. Pete said it was healthful and satisfying.
None disputed the latter quality. Pete’s rooms&mdash;there
were two of them&mdash;were quite as unique as
his surroundings.</p>

<p>Picture a bare, plank-ceiled loft, some forty feet
long by twenty feet broad, divided in the exact center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by a partition of half-inch matched boards and lighted
by five windows. Imagine the walls and ceiling painted
a pea-green, mentally hang two big oil-lamps&mdash;one in
the middle of each room&mdash;from the latter, and spread
half a dozen skins&mdash;bear, coyote, antelope, and cougar&mdash;over
the discolored floor, and you have Pete’s apartments.
There was a door in the partition, but as it
wouldn’t close, owing to inequalities in the casing, it
was always open.</p>

<p>The furniture, of which there was very little, represented
Centerport’s best: there was a “golden-oak”
bureau, a “Flemish-oak” easy chair, a “Chippendale”
card-table&mdash;I am employing the dealer’s language&mdash;an
iron bedstead, a “mahogany” study table, a sprinkling
of brightly upholstered, straight-backed chairs, and a
few other pieces, equally highly polished and equally
disturbing to the esthetic eye.</p>

<p>The walls were almost, but not quite, bare. Pete
didn’t care for pictures, but on nails driven at haphazard
hung a silver-mounted bridle, a rawhide lariat,
a villainous-looking pair of Mexican wheel-spurs, a
leather-banded sombrero, a cartridge-belt and holster,
the latter holding a revolver, a leather quirt, and an
Indian war-drum, while over the bedstead in the back
room the head of a grizzly bear perpetually resented
intrusion with snarling lips. The head of a mountain-sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
held a place of honor in the other apartment, and
underneath it hung a Navajo Indian blanket, almost
worth its weight in gold.</p>

<p>There were only two objects that might have been
set down in an inventory as pictures: one was an advertising
calendar and the other a photograph of Pete’s
mother, who had died soon after Pete’s advent in the
world. The photograph shared the top of the dazzling
yellow bureau with Pete’s brushes and shaving utensils.</p>

<p>In a corner of the front room was a trunk, covered
with a yellow and red saddle-blanket. Against it leaned
two guns&mdash;a battered Winchester carbine and a handsome
two-barreled 12-gauge shot-gun. In another corner,
as though thrown there the moment before, lay a
brown leather stock saddle, with big hooded stirrups.
The card-table held Pete’s smoking things&mdash;two corn-cob
pipes, a small sack of granulated tobacco, and an
ash-tray. The tobacco usually distributed itself over
the table and the ashes always blew onto the floor.</p>

<p>In bright weather, the sunlight streamed in through
three of the five windows and crossed the rooms in
golden shafts, wherein the dust atoms danced and
swirled. With the sunlight came the sounds of the
neighborhood&mdash;the clang of the blacksmith’s sledge
against the anvil, the screech of the carpenter’s plane,
the steady <em>tap</em>, <em>tap</em>, <em>tap</em> of the harness-maker’s hammer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the stamping of horses’ hoofs, the clamor of passing
trains, and the chatter of the loiterers below the windows.
Pete called the front room the “corral,” the
rear room the “stable,” the whole the “Ranch.”</p>

<p>If I have risked tiring the reader with too long a
description of Pete’s dwelling-place, it is because, in
spite of their strange furnishings and hideous green
walls, the rooms were far more homelike than many a
smart suite in Grace Hall, and, to quote Tommy again,
were “Pete through and through.” Further, while
Allan’s, Hal’s, and Tommy’s rooms sometimes served
as meeting-places for the four, the chambers over the
harness-shop were their favorite resort. There was an
undeniable charm about them; and if you could prevail
upon Pete to close a few of the windows in cold
weather, and if you didn’t mind sitting upon the
tables and the trunk, you could be very comfy at the
Ranch.</p>

<small>PETE’S CLUB TABLE</small></h2>


<p>On the Monday night succeeding the Robinson game
the quartet was assembled in Pete’s study. Allan had
the easy chair, Hal and Tommy shared the big table,
and Pete sat on the trunk. The windows were closed,
for the night was cold, and the big hanging lamp diffused
light, warmth, and a strong odor of kerosene
through the apartment. This odor Pete was heroically
striving to mitigate with the fumes of a cob pipe. Hal
had tried the other pipe, but had soon given it up,
avowing discontentedly that Pete ought to keep some
real tobacco on hand for guests who weren’t used to
chopped hay. The bell in College Hall had just struck
nine, and Tommy, for the fourth time, had slid from
the table, pleading press of business, and had been
pulled back by Hal.</p>

<p>“Forget your old business, Tommy,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him sneak,” said Pete. “We’re going
to open a can of corn in a minute.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” Tommy protested, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I’ve got things to do. You lazy chaps, who never
study&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dismal groans from the opposition.</p>

<p>“Can afford to loaf; but I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course you do, Tommy,” Allan interrupted,
soothingly, “but we don’t want you to. Be calm,
precious youth; the Purp” (college slang for the
Purple) “will come out just the same, whether you
continue to adorn that desk for another ten minutes
or not.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you fellows let a couple of weeks go
by without putting out a paper?” asked Pete. “No
one would notice it, and think what a high old time
you could all have being useful for once.”</p>

<p>“Wish we could,” sighed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Tommy, you’re a wicked liar!” said Hal. “You
don’t wish anything of the sort. If you missed an
issue of that old sheet, you’d commit suicide in some
awful manner; maybe you’d come down here and die
of smells.”</p>

<p>“If you’d only put something in it,” said Pete,
“something a fellow could read and enjoy&mdash;a murder
now and then, or a lynching. Couldn’t you run a story
with lots of blood? It’s such a dismal paper, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“You fellows might jump into the river,” suggested
Tommy, scathingly. “We’d print your obits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our which?” Hal asked.</p>

<p>“Obits&mdash;obituaries,” he explained in a superior
manner.</p>

<p>“Would you put ’em on the fir?” asked Peter.</p>

<p>“On the fir? What’s the fir?”</p>

<p>“Fir&mdash;first page.” Pete mimicked Tommy’s tone.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy, when the laughter had stopped,
“not important enough.”</p>

<p>“Crushed and lifeless!” murmured Allan.</p>

<p>“Tommy,” asked Pete, severely, “do you mean
that I’m not enough of a heavy-weight to be dishonored
by having my name on the front page of that old up-country
weekly of yours?”</p>

<p>“The front page is for important news,” said
Tommy, with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>“Such as measles in the grammar school and the
election of Greaves as president of the Chess Club,”
explained Hal.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do with you, Thomas,”
said Pete. “I’ll bet you anything from an old hat to
a quarter section of land that I can get my name and
a half a column of talkee-talkee on the first page of
the Erskine Purple any time I want to. Now, what
say, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you can’t,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>“What’ll you bet? Money talks, my son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, most anything. If you want your name on
the front page of the Purple, you’ll have to do some
tall stunts.”</p>

<p>“Of course, that’s what I mean: kill the Dean, or
blow up College Hall, or have a fit in chapel.”</p>

<p>“Or subscribe for the paper,” added Allan.</p>

<p>“Come, Tommy, speak up. What will you bet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out, you wild Indian! I’m going home.”</p>

<p>He made another effort to tear himself away.</p>

<p>“Tommy, you’re a coyote: you’re skeered an’
afeared. You know I’d win.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m not,” said Tommy. “I’ll bet a dinner
for the four of us at the Elm Tree that you can’t get
your name on the front page while I’m on the paper&mdash;
Hold on, though; I won’t bet that. I’ll bet you won’t
get it there this year unless it’s merely the name, as a
member of a society, or as having attended a meeting,
or something like that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Thomas, you’re hedging,” said Pete, “but I’ll
take your bet. And just my name isn’t to count; nothing
less than a full paragraph to myself goes. You
fellows are witnesses.”</p>

<p>“We are,” said Allan. “I smell that dinner already.”</p>

<p>“And you see Pete paying the bill,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who pays, and I don’t care.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“He cares not who pays for his dinner, so long as
he may eat it,” said Hal. “Wise child, Allan. And,
by the way, talking of eating reminds me. You know
Billy Greb, Allan?”</p>

<p>“I’m going home,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“(Shut up and sit down, Tommy!) Billy’s getting
up a freshman club table and wants you and me to
join. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Where’s it going to be?”</p>

<p>“Pearson’s.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Six a week.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty steep, Hal. Besides, I may go to
the track-team table in the spring.”</p>

<p>“I’m going home, you fellows,” announced Tommy
again.</p>

<p>“Will you please shut up?” asked Hal. “Well,
you’d better join until then, Allan; sufficient to the
spring is the evil thereof.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think it over and let you know in a
day or two. When does Greb want to start it?”</p>

<p>“First of the month. If you weren’t a foolish
little sophomore, Tommy, you could come in too.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” answered Tommy, scathingly. “I’ve
seen all I want of freshman club tables. I’m going&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“How about me, Hal?” asked Pete. “I’d like to
join, if your friend will have me.”</p>

<p>Hal hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;I’ll speak to him about it. But I think
he’s got his number made up.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Pete, quietly.</p>

<p>“But I’ll do my best,” said Hal, hurriedly and
awkwardly. “Maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Call it off!” said Pete, with a cavernous yawn.</p>

<p>“If it was my table&mdash;” continued Hal, anxious not
to hurt the other’s feelings.</p>

<p>“I know. <em>That’s</em> all right. I can stand it.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of a gently closing door.</p>

<p>“Hello!” Pete exclaimed. “Where’s Tommy?”</p>

<p>The three glanced in surprise around the room.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think,” said Allan, dryly, “I <em>think</em> I heard him
say something about going home.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon Pete found Allan at the gymnasium,
and walked back to Mrs. Purdy’s with him.
He was so quiet that Allan was certain he had something
on his mind. What that something was transpired
when they had reached Allan’s room.</p>

<p>“What sort of a cayuse&mdash;meaning gentleman&mdash;is
this fellow Greb?” asked Pete.</p>

<p>“I don’t know him very well,” Allan replied, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
I fancy he thinks himself a bit of a swell. He’s a
Dunlap Hall fellow, and of course you know what that
means.”</p>

<p>“Never heard tell of it,” said Pete. “What is it&mdash;a
preparatory school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s&mdash; Oh, it’s all right, of course, only
we used to make a good deal of fun of it at Hillton.
You go there when you’re nine or ten, and they give
you a sort of a governess to look after you until you
get old enough to make her life a burden; then they
put you in another house. They’re terribly English,
you know; have forms and fagging; and when you
want a row with a chap, you have to notify the captain
of your form, and it’s all arranged for you like a regular
duel, and you go out back of one of the buildings,
and somebody holds your coat for you and somebody
else mops your face with a sponge, and you try and hit
the other fellow in the eye. It’s like a second edition of
Tom Brown. Think of getting mad with a chap in the
morning and having to wait until afternoon to whack
him! There’s no fun in that. You’d like as not want
to beg his pardon and buy him a ‘Sunday’! But they
think they’re a pretty elegant lot, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Think of that!” sighed Pete. “And I might
have gone there, if I’d known, and had a nurse and
all the scrapping I wanted. So this fellow Greb thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he’s the whole thing, does he? Guess that’s the reason
Hal was hunting a hole when I asked myself to join.
I didn’t know you were so mighty choice about who
you ate with. Out there we ask whoever comes along.
I guess you fellows thought I was loco, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Thought you were what?”</p>

<p>“Why, crazy, inviting myself like that.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Pete; we all understood. There was
no harm done. It’s just that Greb wants to get up a
table of fellows he knows.”</p>

<p>“Does he know you?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;I’ve met him, of course.”</p>

<p>“And he could have met me if he’d wanted to,
couldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he could, but he doesn’t know about
you.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t care to, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Pete; you’re making a lot out of
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Dare say he thinks I eat in my shirt-sleeves and
swallow my knife,” continued Pete, gloomily. “Maybe
he thinks I live on horned toads and grasshoppers.”</p>

<p>“But, I tell you, he doesn’t know you.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s heard of me,” answered Pete.
“Guess he knew you and Hal and I were traveling
together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, Pete; if you want to join a club
table&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all right. Moocha wano club table.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” answered Allan, a bit puzzled.</p>

<p>“I’m going to join a club table on the 1st,” said
Pete.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Allan, again. “What&mdash;that is, whose
is it?”</p>

<p>“Pete Burley’s.”</p>

<p>“What! How&mdash;how do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean I’m going to run my own grub-wagon. And
I want you to join.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash; Look here, Pete, I don’t believe you can
find a decent place to take you. Everything’s full up
already.”</p>

<p>“Where is there a decent place?” asked Pete,
calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Pearson’s, of course, but you
couldn’t get in there. And&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Because she takes training tables chiefly, and is
pretty particular, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what she told me,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“Then you went there?”</p>

<p>Pete nodded.</p>

<p>“I could have told you you wouldn’t get in there.
There’s a pretty good place further along&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all right. We start on the 1st.”</p>

<p>“Start where?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Pearson’s.”</p>

<p>“Pete, you’re lying!” gasped Allan.</p>

<p>“No, straight talk. I engaged the front corner
room on the second floor. It’s a right nice-looking
place: paper on the walls, fireplace, lounge, window-seat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but how’d you do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all right. We had a little pow-wow.
It’s going to be six a week and no extras.”</p>

<p>“You crazy Westerner!” said Allan, in bewildered
admiration. Then, “But you haven’t got any one to
join, have you?”</p>

<p>“Not yet; but <em>that’ll</em> be all right. It’s going to
be select, you know; eight in all. There’ll be you and
me, that’s two; and Hal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll come,” said Allan, doubtfully.
“You see, Pete, he’s promised Greb.”</p>

<p>“I don’t guess Greb will have a table,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, where’s he going to put it?”</p>

<p>Allan stared. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you’ve got Greb’s room?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“’Twa’n’t his,” answered Pete, coolly. “He hadn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
settled the matter, and so I said I’d take it and put
down a forfeit. And there isn’t another decent place
for a high-toned, pedigreed chap like him to go to.”</p>

<p>“Pete Burley, you’re a wonder!” breathed Allan.</p>

<p>“Think Hal will join?” asked Pete, unmoved by
the tribute. Allan nodded silently.</p>

<p>“That’ll make three, then. Now, of course, I know
lots of fellows who would come in if I asked ’em, but,
as I just said, this thing is going to be select; it’s
going to be the selectest table in town. So you tell
me who are the top of the bunch in our class, and I’ll
go and fetch ’em in if I have to rope ’em and hog-tie
’em.” Pete took out a pencil and began to write on
the back of an envelope.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s all poppycock,” said Allan, “but&mdash;well,
there’s What’s-his-name, the class president,
and Maitland, and Poor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whoo-ee! I’m glad you thought of Poor.”</p>

<p>“And Armstrong&mdash;only he lives at home, I think&mdash;and
Mays, and Wolcott, and&mdash;and Cooper&mdash;Cooper
of St. Eustace, I mean; the other chap’s an awful
duffer&mdash;and Van Sciver&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whoa, Bill! That’s eight&mdash;eleven, counting us
three; guess I can get enough out of the list. Besides,
I must ask Greb; mustn’t slight Greb.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to ask him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’t I? Just you keep your eyes peeled and
you’ll see.” He got up and carefully put the list in
the big yellow leather wallet he carried. “Guess I’ll
see a few of ’em this afternoon. Want to come along?”</p>

<p>Allan shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>“Not me, Pete. I don’t want to have to testify
against you before the faculty. How do I know what
you’ll do to those chaps to make them join?”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Allan!” Pete turned at the gate. “Remember
those ducks we saw on the river last week?
Well, let’s go after ’em Thursday morning, will you?”</p>

<p>“Shooting, you mean? I haven’t a gun.”</p>

<p>“You take my shot-gun and I’ll use the rifle. I’ve
shot ducks with a rifle before this.”</p>

<p>“All right, Pete, but like as not the silly ducks
won’t be there Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll find something to shoot, all right, if
it’s just squirrels. We’ll have nothing to do Thursday,
and can stay as long as we like; make a day of it.
Maybe we can find some place to have dinner and
won’t have to come back here. I’m getting mighty
tired of commons, Allan. Well, it’ll be considerable
different when we get the table started, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Allan.</p>

<p>“Say, do you think Hal or Tommy would go
along?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ducking? Tommy might, but Hal’s going to sign
off and go home over Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Lucky chap!” sighed Pete. “Wish I was.” He
looked thoughtfully across the leaf-strewn college yard.
“Suppose I could, but&mdash;guess the old man would raise
Cain. Allan!”</p>

<p>“Yep?”</p>

<p>“I’d give a hundred dollars for sight of a mountain.
Well, I must jog along.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE DUCK HUNT</small></h2>


<p>Thanksgiving Day dawned cloudy and still, with
a hint of snow in the air. Allan slept late, in enjoyment
of holiday privileges, and Pete was banging at
his front window before he had finished dressing.</p>

<p>They reached Brown Hall a bare two minutes before
the doors closed, and hurried through a light breakfast.
Ten o’clock found them walking briskly along
the Morrisville road, some four miles from college, having
crossed the river by the county bridge and turned
to the left through the little town of Kirkplain, which
is opposite Centerport. Allan wore a white sweater,
over which he had pulled an old coat; the pockets of
the latter were bulging with shells. Pete wore a canvas
hunting-coat and carried his cartridges in a belt.
The Winchester was slung over his shoulder, and altogether
he made a formidable appearance. Allan had
the shot-gun. Tommy had refused to accompany them,
pleading, as ever, a press of business; Hal had taken
himself off to the bosom of his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>So far they had seen nothing to shoot at save a
red squirrel. Allan had impulsively sought to bring
that down, but had failed for the excellent reason that
he had forgotten to load. The squirrel had seemed to
appreciate the humor of the incident and had chattered
in their faces from the bough of a dead maple-tree.
Allan had been glad afterward that the gun hadn’t
gone off.</p>

<p>The blunder reminded Pete of a parallel case in
his own experience, and he had told it so well that
Allan had been forced to sit on a rock in order to
recover from his fit of laughter. This story led to
others. Pete proved a perfect mine of interesting
narratives on hunting adventure, some of them
laughable, some of them so exciting that Allan forgot
how heavy the shot-gun under his arm had
become.</p>

<p>When they struck the cross-roads, some three miles
from Kirkplain, they were in the best of spirits. They
took the road to the left, which leads down to the river
and the ferry to Harwich. At the ferry they left
beaten tracks and followed the river-bank.</p>

<p>The travel was slower now, both because they had
to break their way through underbrush, make detours
around inlets, cross brooks, and climb an occasional
fence, and because they were keeping their eyes open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for game. Allan had never done much hunting, and
he was becoming quite excited at the prospect.</p>

<p>Pete led the way, forcing his big body through the
bushes with scarce a sound, while Allan could make
no progress without causing enough disturbance to
frighten any self-respecting duck a mile distant. Pete
seemed to realize this fact, for he frequently looked
back at Allan with pursed lips and violent shakes of
his head, and then glanced anxiously at the river.
After a half mile of this, Pete stopped in a little clearing
and leaned his rifle against a bush. Allan joined
him, very much out of breath.</p>

<p>“See anything?” he panted, hoarsely. Pete shook
his head.</p>

<p>A few yards away lay the river, sluggish and leaden
under gray sky. At their backs the ground rose gently,
and the reeds and bushes gave place to a thick growth
of trees. A few rods further up-stream was a little
promontory. Everything was very still save for the
chirp of the birds in the woods and the infrequent
screech of a locomotive-whistle from toward Centerport.
Across the river and further down-stream the
little hamlet of Harwich nestled under its leafless elms.
Pete sat down and drew forth his corn-cob pipe.</p>

<p>“Might as well take a rest,” he said. “Smoke?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” Allan didn’t possess a pipe of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
own, and wouldn’t have attempted Pete’s for a ten-dollar
bill; the very smell of it frequently made him
faint. Pete stuffed the blackened bowl full of dry
tobacco and lighted it. Then he leaned back on one
elbow and puffed contentedly for a moment. Allan
nibbled the end of a grass-blade and stared across the
empty stream.</p>

<p>“This is about the place where we saw those birds
the other day,” said Pete, finally. “Guess they’ve
pulled their freight. Sorry!”</p>

<p>“What’s the diff?” asked Allan. “We’ve had the
walk. Besides, maybe we’ll find a gray squirrel if we
go back through the woods.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I don’t guess there’s any use going farther
up the river. What time is it, I wonder? Did
you bring your watch?”</p>

<p>“Quarter of twelve,” said Allan. “Getting
hungry?”</p>

<p>“I could eat a saddle!” answered Pete. “Supposing
we go back and take the ferry over to Harwich?
Is there any place there we could get a feed?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I should think there ought to
be. Got any money?”</p>

<p>Pete sat up suddenly and searched his pockets.</p>

<p>“Not a red!” he exclaimed. “I forgot to change.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Allan, dolefully. Pete picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his pipe up from where it had fallen and relighted it.
Then he threw himself onto his back, put one leg over
the other knee, and chuckled.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s so terribly funny,” said Allan,
aggrievedly. “We can’t get home until three or four
o’clock. Wish we’d had sense enough to bring lunch
with us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; a half dozen sandwiches and a piece of pie
wouldn’t go so bad, would they? Nice thick sandwiches,
with ham or beef inside, and lots of butter
and mustard. And&mdash;what kind of pie do you like
best, Allan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, you!”</p>

<p>“I like pumpkin&mdash;or, maybe, apple. Yes, apple’s
pretty hard to beat. We’ll have apple; about three
pieces each.”</p>

<p>Allan groaned and threw a handful of dried grass
into Pete’s face. Pete brushed it aside and went on:</p>

<p>“When we get the table going, we’ll get Mother
Pearson to give us apple-pie every night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you do!” growled Allan.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all right, my son. Just because the
only fellow I’ve found wouldn’t join, you needn’t think
that table isn’t going to be. Hal’s going to introduce
me to Maitland and Van Something&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Van Sciver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you say so. And Cooper; and I’ll bet you a
bunch of cows I get that table filled up inside of a
week. Want to bet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t bet,” said Allan, aggravatingly. “Besides,
if I were you, I’d go slow on betting until I’d
paid for that dinner.”</p>

<p>“What dinner?”</p>

<p>“The one you wagered with Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Ginger! I’d clean forgotten that. But <em>that’ll</em>
be all right.”</p>

<p>“You’ll lose.”</p>

<p>“Lose nothing! Just you hold your horses and
keep your eye on your Uncle Pete. Let’s think what
we’ll make Tommy order for us at that feed.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go home and get something to eat,” said
Allan, irritably.</p>

<p>“Home? Not a bit of it! We’ll find a house and
beg a Thanksgiving dinner, that’s what we’ll do. Saddle
up and let’s mosey along.” He dropped his pipe
into his pocket and got to his feet. “There’s bound
to be a house somewhere’s about; look at how the woods
have been cleared out here. Shouldn’t wonder if we
found eight courses and a Hinglish butler.”</p>

<p>“One course’ll do me,” groaned Allan, as he got
up, “and I don’t care how coarse it is.”</p>

<p>“We shot a man out in our county for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a joke like that, and he was a heap homelier than you&mdash;
<em>Listen!</em>”</p>

<p>Allan listened. From beyond the little promontory
came the unmistakable quack of a duck. Pete pumped
a cartridge into the barrel of his carbine and tiptoed
toward the shore. Allan seized his shot-gun, fell over
a stone, and followed. Pete waved him back, and then
returned.</p>

<p>“They’re around that point. We’ve got to go
mighty quiet; if we don’t, they’ll fly. Keep low
until you get to the pebbles there, and then get down
and crawl. Come on!”</p>

<p>Allan followed, watching each footstep and trying
not to breathe. A clump of trees came down almost
to the water at the point, and hid what was beyond.
But when Allan had, by painfully wriggling his body,
stomach to earth, reached the little expanse of pebbled
shore and Pete’s side, his heart leaped for joy. Before
them was a little cove, and in it, peacefully moving
about its surface, was a flock of ducks. How many
there were, he couldn’t tell; there seemed dozens at
first. He threw his gun to his shoulder and squinted
along the barrel.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” whispered Pete. “We’ll have to
scare ’em up somehow.”</p>

<p>“What for?” Allan whispered, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t shoot ducks in the water, you idiot!”
answered Pete. “Here, I’ll raise ’em with this stone.
Be ready and take ’em as they rise. Wait till you
get two together, but shoot quick, and let ’em have
both barrels.”</p>

<p>He dug a small stone out of the sand and aiming
at the middle of the flock, let drive. There was a
sensation among the ducks, but not the panic Pete
had looked for. They swam away from the spot where
the stone sank, and made a good deal of fuss, but not
a duck took wing. Pete grunted and threw another
rock. The result was the same. The ducks discussed
the matter volubly among themselves and swam around
in circles, but they didn’t show any intention of flying
away. Pete was disgusted.</p>

<p>“I’m going to knock that old drake’s head off,” he
whispered. “I guess that’ll bring ’em up. All ready?”</p>

<p>Allan nodded, clutching his gun desperately and
still squinting along the barrels. There was a loud
report, then another, and a third. Two ducks floated
quietly on the water. The others, with wild quacks
of dismay, paddled to shore and disappeared into the
bushes.</p>

<p>“Well, of all crazy ducks!” ejaculated Pete, staring
after them.</p>

<p>“They&mdash;they didn’t fly!” said Allan, breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fly! Why, the things are clean locoed! They’re
not ducks, they’re&mdash;they’re&mdash;<em>I</em> don’t know what they
are!”</p>

<p>Pete stared about him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“They didn’t fly, and so I shot,” Allan explained.</p>

<p>“And we only got two!” said Pete, disgustedly.</p>

<p>“But they went up there,” said Allan. “Why
can’t we go after them?”</p>

<p>“And shoot ’em on land?” Pete shook his head
slowly. “Allan, I’ve done fool things in my time, but
I never shot ducks on land.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what difference it makes,” objected
Allan.</p>

<p>“Maybe not; maybe you’re used to crazy ducks.
I’m not. I refuse to have further dealings with such&mdash;such
freaks of nature. How we going to get those?”
he asked, nodding at the dead birds.</p>

<p>“We ought to have brought a dog.”</p>

<p>“Or a rowboat. Well, here goes!” He sat down
and took off his shoes and stockings. Then, with his
trousers rolled up as far as they would go, he waded
out into the water. Allan sat down on the bank and
promised to rescue him if he went over his depth. Pete
reached the first bird&mdash;it was the drake he had shot,
and it lacked a head&mdash;and held it up. He studied it
a moment, shaking his head slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Allan.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing; nothing at all. Only I never saw
a duck like this before in my life!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with&mdash;” began Allan.
Then the words stopped and he jumped to his feet.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Sorry you don’t approve of them,”</a> said a voice
behind him, “but they’re the best I’ve got!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>DINNER FOR TWO</small></h2>


<p>The regret, politely expressed though it was, had
the effect of a thunderbolt on both Allan and Pete,
neither of whom had heard or seen anything to suggest
the presence of a third person on the scene. Allan’s
surprise was ludicrous enough, but the picture presented
by Pete&mdash;mouth and eyes wide open and the
headless duck held stiffly at arm’s length, his whole
attitude suggesting that the icy water in which he stood
had suddenly frozen him stiff&mdash;caused even the newcomer
to smile a little under his mustache.</p>

<p>The latter was a rather stout gentleman, of middle
age, with ruddy cheeks, piercing dark eyes, and an
expression of extreme self-possession. He wore a suit
of rough gray tweed and leather leggings and carried
a shot-gun. At his side, exhibiting two rows of very
white teeth, stood a red and white setter. Allan liked
neither the gun nor the dog, and envied Pete his chilly,
but more distant, position. The newcomer glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
silently from Allan to Pete. It was the latter who
found his voice first.</p>

<p>“Those your ducks?” he asked.</p>

<p>The man nodded. Pete looked again at the drake
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said.</p>

<p>The dog growled and Allan observed that the man’s
gun was cocked and that it was held in a position that
was far from reassuring. Pete regarded the man with
a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“Look here, partner,” he asked, “are those <em>tame</em>
ducks?”</p>

<p>“They are, sir.”</p>

<p>Pete’s face cleared; a grin overspread his features,
and he chuckled aloud as he waded back to shore.</p>

<p>“You seem amused?” said the man, politely but
with a note of interrogation.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty relieved, as the broncho said
when he bucked the man off. You see, I thought they
were wild ducks, and when they wouldn’t fly, I was
afraid they were degenerating. Of course, as they
were tame ducks, it’s all right.” Pete waded out of
the water and the setter laid back his ears and growled
suspiciously. “Hello, dog!” said Pete, as he went
toward where he had deposited his shoes, stockings, and
rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just stay where you are, please!” said the man.
He waved toward Pete’s possessions. The dog trotted
over to them and stood guard, watching their owner
intently. Pete’s grin broadened. He tossed down the
duck he had rescued.</p>

<p>“There’s another out there,” he said. “Guess the
dog could get it, couldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Where do you gentlemen belong?” asked the man.
The gentlemen exchanged glances. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Centerport,” answered Allan.</p>

<p>“Students?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the owner of the ducks. “Want
me to believe you thought my ducks were wild ones,
do you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose we’d walk six miles to shoot
tame ones, do you?” asked Pete, scathingly. The man
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re ready to pay for the pair you’ve
shot?”</p>

<p>“Glad to,” answered Pete. “How much?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess a dollar will do. They were both
Pekins.”</p>

<p>“Can’t say I’ve had a dollar’s worth of sport,” said
Pete, “but here’s your money.” He put a hand into
his trouser pocket. Then he stopped short and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with dismay at Allan. The owner of the ducks waited
silently.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to trust us, partner,” said Pete.
“We both came away without any money.” Allan,
fearing arrest would follow this announcement, held his
breath. But the man only smiled courteously.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he answered. “There is no hurry.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Pete. He looked inquiringly
toward the dog. “How about my shoes and stockings?
It’s a bit chilly.”</p>

<p>“I fancy your walk back will warm you up,” said
the man. Pete whistled.</p>

<p>“Going to keep ’em for security, eh?” he asked.
The other nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t compromise, I suppose?” Pete insinuated.
“That carbine’s worth a good bit more’n a dollar.
It’s hard walking without any shoes.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” was the reply. “But maybe if you
stub your toe a few times, it’ll remind you to find out
whether a duck is domestic or wild before you shoot it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is,” said
Allan, explosively, “you’ll get your old dollar. We’re
not thieves. But you’ve got to let him have his shoes
and stockings.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t?” asked the man, with a flicker of
appreciation in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why&mdash;we’ll just take them, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you could do it?” said the other,
measuring the two with his eyes. “I almost believe
you could.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;” began Allan.</p>

<p>“But of course you’d get damaged in the process,”
continued the other, cheerfully. “Now, look here;
you’ve killed my ducks, and it’s only right that you
should pay for them. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but if we have no money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” was the answer. “It doesn’t seem
probable that you two students would come six miles
from college without any money. Where are you going
to get your dinner?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t going to be any dinner,” said Pete.
“You can believe us or not, just as you like, and be
hanged to you! If you’ll put down your gun, I’ll
lick you.”</p>

<p>“That’s an honest offer,” said the man, smiling
outright for the first time, “but it isn’t just practical.
I rather think you could do it, and I don’t see why I
should be licked merely because you have killed my
ducks. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so, partner,” Pete answered. “But
something’s got to be done. I can’t walk home without
any shoes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The man received this assertion in silence, glancing
thoughtfully from Pete to the articles in discussion.
The dog looked suspiciously from Pete to Allan. Allan
scowled at the dog’s master. The latter spoke:</p>

<p>“Here, Jack!”</p>

<p>Jack went to him unwillingly. Pete picked up his
shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” he said. Then he put them on. The
man watched him smilingly. When the last lace was
tied, Pete got up.</p>

<p>“My name’s Burley,” he said. “I’ll come over
with your money to-morrow or next day. Come on,
Allan. Good day, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re forgetting your rifle,” said the man. Pete
looked puzzled. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do I get that, too?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, you might as well take that along, I guess.”
Pete went back and got it. “Where you going now?”
asked the man.</p>

<p>“Home,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“But how about dinner?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we’ll beg something to eat on the
way. I guess there ain’t any place around here where
they’d take a Winchester carbine as security for a
Thanksgiving dinner, is there?” asked Pete, with a
smile. The stranger answered the smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hardly. But I tell you what you do. Strike
straight up through the woods here over the hill till
you come to a lane. Keep along that for a quarter of
a mile until you come to a big brown house standing
back from the lane. You go there and tell ’em you’re
hungry, and you’ll get plenty to eat. Ask for Mr.
Guild. Don’t forget, now; first house you come to.
There isn’t another for a mile further, so you’d better
follow my advice.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” said Pete. Allan echoed him.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man, smiling kindly. “Good
morning, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” they answered. They started off
through the woods in the direction he had indicated,
but after a few yards Allan turned and looked back.
The man, with the setter at heel, was moving along
a path at right angles to them. He glanced up and
waved his hand.</p>

<p>“We’re sorry about the ducks,” called Allan.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Pete shouted.</p>

<p>The man nodded good-naturedly. Then the trees
hid him.</p>

<p>Allan and Pete walked on in silence for a ways.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Say, he wasn’t such a bad sort, was he?” asked
Allan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he’s all right. I don’t believe he was going
to do any more than scare us, anyway. Guess he was
just having some fun with us.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it funny about the ducks being tame
ones?” asked Allan, presently, as they left the woods,
climbed over a stone wall, and struck off up a lane.</p>

<p>“That’s a joke on me,” said Pete, laughing. “Ginger!
How was I to know that folks left their old ducks
floating around loose all over the country here? Out
our way, when you see a duck in a lake or on the
river, it’s a wild duck, and you just naturally go ahead
and shoot it. That’s what bothered me&mdash;those fool
ducks sitting there and letting me throw rocks at ’em.
Next time&mdash; Say, I guess that’s our ranch over there.”</p>

<p>Allan’s gaze followed the other’s.</p>

<p>A turn in the lane laid bare a broad expanse of
lawn, interspersed with ornamental trees and shrubbery,
beyond which stood a long, rambling house of
brown-shingled walls and numerous red chimneys.
Farther off were stables and barns. From the chimneys
the smoke arose straight into the still air, suggesting
warmth and good cheer. The boys paused and looked
longingly across the lawn.</p>

<p>“Shall we try it?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Pete said. “I’m so hungry I could eat
cedar bark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what will they think?” Allan demurred.
“It isn’t as though it were a farmhouse, you know.”</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> all right; the sweller the folks the better
the rations. Come on; let’s cut across here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll just ask for some bread and a glass of milk,”
suggested Allan.</p>

<p>“Bread and milk? Ginger! I’ve got to have pie
and hot coffee!”</p>

<p>“But we’ll go to the back door, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Like tramps? Not a bit of it. We’ll go to the
front. What was the name he told us?”</p>

<p>“Guild.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; Guild. Hello! look there; there’s
another one of those setter dogs. Looks just like the
beast the fellow back there had, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>But this dog only observed them indifferently from
a respectful distance, and then trotted around the corner
of the house as they mounted the broad steps,
crossed a wide veranda, and pushed the ivory button
beside the big oaken door. Allan strove to appear at
ease, but in reality looked as though he had come to
steal the family silver. A neatly-aproned maid opened
the door.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Guild in?” asked Pete, with unruffled
composure.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Will you please walk in?” They followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her into a library, in which a wood fire was
crackling merrily in the chimney-place. Allan felt
like an impostor. Pete calmly selected the easiest
chair and lowered himself into it with a deep sigh of
contentment.</p>

<p>“This is something like!” he said. “I’ll bet we’ll
get two or three kinds of pie, Allan.”</p>

<p>But Allan, sitting uncomfortably on the edge of a
straight-backed chair, only smiled distressedly and listened
to the footsteps coming nearer and nearer down
the uncarpeted hall. The footsteps reached the door;
Pete and Allan got to their feet as the door swung
open.</p>

<p>“Mr. Guild&mdash;” began Pete. Then he stopped
short.</p>

<p>Before them was the owner of the ducks!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE CAPSIZED BOAT</small></h2>


<p>Allan and Pete didn’t forget that day for a long
time. In retrospect, it was the brightest one between
the beginning of the college year and the Christmas
recess. For long afterward Pete would point with
pride to his performance at table on that day, and
declare that he believed that should he live to be a
hundred he could never eat as much again. Dinner
began at two o’clock and ended, not because of lack
of further viands but because of inability on the part
of the guests, at half-past four.</p>

<p>The family at Hillcrest consisted of Mr. Guild, his
wife, a pleasant-faced and sweet-voiced woman several
years his junior, and a three-year-old son and heir,
who did not make his appearance at table but who was
afterward ceremoniously introduced in the nursery.
Both host and hostess appeared to have no other desire
in life than to make the two guests happy and utterly
ruin their digestions.</p>

<p>Even Pete had had momentary qualms over appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
at table in the unconventional attire of shooting-coat
and flannel shirt, but their objections had been
politely overruled, and by the time the turkey had made
its appearance they had both lost sight of the fact that
they were not dressed in the mode. It was while carving
the turkey that the morning’s episode was recalled.</p>

<p>“This, Mr. Burley,” said their host, “is only
turkey. Had there been more time, we would have
had a duck prepared for you.”</p>

<p>Allan wondered, while he laughed, whether Mrs.
Guild had heard the story of the duck-hunt. The demure
expression about her mouth led him to suspect
that she had.</p>

<p>After dinner they adjourned to the library again,
and Pete was induced to smoke a cigar, although, as
Allan guessed, he would much rather have used his
corn-cob pipe. Mrs. Guild disappeared for a while,
and Pete and Allan stretched themselves luxuriously
in front of the fire and listened to their host and did
a good deal of talking themselves. Mr. Guild led them
to tell of their college life, and displayed such sympathy
with their views and ambitions that at the end
of an hour the two boys had become his enthusiastic
admirers. He knew the West like a book, and Pete
became quite excited&mdash;for Pete&mdash;swapping recollections
and stories of “out there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Guild appeared again, and they
went into the drawing-room and sat silent and happy
in the firelight while she played for them. She apologized
for knowing no college songs, but Pete gallantly
assured her that he preferred “straight music.” Still
later there was a four-handed game of billiards in an
upper hall, in which Mrs. Guild and Allan were badly
defeated by the host and Pete. Then came the visit
to the pink-hung nursery and the formal introductions
to Master Thomas Guild, Junior. And by that time
it was after eight o’clock, and a surrey stood at the
door, waiting to bear them back to Centerport.</p>

<p>“You must come out some afternoon,” said their
host, “and let me show you around. Both Mrs. Guild
and I have enjoyed your visit, and we want you again.
We don’t have so many callers but what a couple more
will be welcome at any time. And when you come, it
must be to stay to dinner with us.”</p>

<p>And Allan and Pete readily agreed, and kept to
their agreement. They each voted Mr. Guild a fine
fellow, and each lost his heart to the hostess. The
dollar was duly paid, and they received a receipt “in
full for two ducks. Trusting to receive a continuance
of your patronage, I remain, Yours faithfully, Thomas
A. Guild.” There was another visit to Hillcrest the
following week, and several more before the occurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the incident which, for a time at least, put thoughts
of visiting out of mind.</p>

<p>On the Monday after Thanksgiving and the duck-hunt,
the story of which was now college property,
Pete stamped into Allan’s room just before dinner,
kicked the snow from his shoes against the chimney,
tossed his sombrero onto the desk, and subsided into
the armchair with a mighty sigh of triumph.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> all right,” he announced, heartily but
vaguely.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Allan, momentarily abandoning
his struggle with Herodotus.</p>

<p>“Club table. I’ve got my eighth man.”</p>

<p>“Not really? Who have you got?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s”&mdash;he took a list from his pocket&mdash;“there’s
you, and Hal, and Wolcott, Poor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pete, you’re lying!”</p>

<p>“&mdash;and Cooper, Van Sciver, Maitland, and your
Uncle Pete.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but how’d you do it, Pete? How’d you
get them to join? Offer to pay half their board, or&mdash;or
what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it just took a little dip-lo-macy, my son; just
a little dip-lo-macy. I started out with you and Hal.
I got Hal to introduce Poor. Then I told Poor I was
getting up a representative table, and got him to promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to join if I secured Maitland and Van Sciver. He
introduced me to Van Sciver. I told him that you
and Hal and Poor had promised, and he came right
over to the party. You were quite a card, my son.
I had no trouble with Cooper when I told him you
were one of our principal sights. And so it went.
After I’d got Poor and Cooper and Van Sciver cinched,
there was nothing left to do but receive and consider
applications. I could have had twenty, but I set out
to make this table exclusive, and exclusive it’s going
to be, if I have to get the Dean&mdash;hang him!” Pete
frowned a moment in silence. Then, “Wolcott was
the last to join; he agreed ten minutes ago; I just
came from his room.”</p>

<p>“Pete, you surely are a lucky dub!” said Allan.
“I don’t believe there’s another fellow in college that
could have got all those chaps together!”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much luck about it,” said Pete,
calmly. “It just took hard work. Why, I haven’t
studied a lick since Wednesday, and I’ve cut half my
recitations. I guess that’s why the Dean wants to
see me.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I had a polite postal card from him yesterday,
and an impolite one to-day.”</p>

<p>“But why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t have time to call on him yesterday;
I was too busy seeing fellows. It seems to have
made him some angry.”</p>

<p>Allan whistled expressively.</p>

<p>“You ought to have gone, Pete. He’ll raise thunder
with you now; see if he don’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all right; he can’t do any worse than
expel me. And I’m getting pretty tired of this shop,
anyway; there isn’t much doing. And now that I’ve
got the table made up, all the excitement’s over with.
I’ve thought all along I wouldn’t be here much after
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up that! Who’s going to run the table,
if you go and get fired? And what do you suppose
I’m going to do, you idiot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you wouldn’t care,” said Pete, sheepishly.
But he seemed rather pleased when Allan threw
Fernald’s Selections at his head.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he’ll let me off easy this time; just
suspend me, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go and see him right away. But
you can’t until to-morrow, now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I guess I’ll call at his house to-night.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t like you to, they say,” cautioned
Allan. “If I were you, I’d wait until morning.”</p>

<p>“No; better have it over with. I’ll drop around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
afterward and tell you about it. Coming to dinner?”</p>

<p>Allan pleaded study, and Pete took himself off.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the Dean was merciful and Pete
was merely placed upon probation&mdash;a fact which appeared
to amuse him vastly.</p>

<p>“It’s just like old times,” he explained to Allan
and Hal, the latter having come in to recount the
wonderful things which had happened to him during
his visit home. “Out in Colorado, I was most always
on probation. Used to feel downright lonesome when
I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough,” said Hal, “but you want
to be careful, for old Levett’s the very dickens if you
get too gay with him. First thing you know, you won’t
know anything.”</p>

<p>“Don’t now,” answered Pete, promptly and cheerfully.
“But I wouldn’t be surprised if something did
drop. The fact is&mdash;” he hesitated, sighed dolefully,
and shook his head, “the fact is, I’ve been feeling lately
that something unpleasant is going to happen to me.
I guess it’s a&mdash;a premonition.”</p>

<p>His tone was quite sad, and Allan and Hal stared
at him in silent surprise. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, you idiot?” asked
Allan.</p>

<p>“Nothing; I dare say it’s just foolishness, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
somehow&mdash;” He sighed again. “Well, <em>that’s</em> all
right,” he went on, with an evident effort at cheerfulness.
“Have a good time, Hal?”</p>

<p>“You’re off your feed, that’s what’s the matter with
you,” said Hal, severely. “Your liver’s out of whack.
Better see the doctor.”</p>

<p>“What’s probation, anyway?” asked Allan, lightly.
“It’s likely to happen to any one.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” Pete replied, dolefully. “But I
don’t want to talk of my troubles,” he continued, with
martyr-like complacency. “Tell us what you did, Hal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re plumb woozy!” exclaimed the latter.
Nevertheless, he consented to tell again of the remarkable
events which had transpired during his absence,
and Pete’s melancholy disappeared. It was a peculiar
feature of it that during the following week it possessed
him only occasionally. But when it did, he
seemed in the uttermost depths of melancholy&mdash;a melancholy
quite as mysterious and remarkable to his
friends as the celerity with which he recovered on each
occasion. Hal declared over and over that he was
“woozy”&mdash;a term of doubtful significance, but quite
satisfying to the user&mdash;and Tommy hinted at overstudy.
This was among themselves. When Pete was
present, they merely called him a fool, and let it go
at that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first day of December that witnessed
the advent upon the scene of a new character in our
story. A wagon stopped in front of Mrs. Purdy’s in
the afternoon and an expressman deposited a small
box inside Allan’s door. He found it there when he
returned from his last recitation. It had slats nailed
across the top, and from its dark recesses came strange
sounds. Allan stared. The sounds resolved themselves
into the plaintive mewings of a kitten, and Allan recollected
his request to his mother&mdash;a request long since
forgotten by him, but evidently well remembered by
her. He tore off a couple of the slats and lifted out a
six-weeks-old kitten.</p>

<p>It was a pathetic little white object, with two black
spots on its back and weak-looking pale blue eyes which
blinked inquiringly at him. Its mouth opened, and the
appealing cry was repeated. Allan set it down and
raced for the kitchen. When he returned, he carried
a huge bowl of milk.</p>

<p>The kitten was roaming disconsolately about the
floor, but at sight of the milk trotted up, and apparently
strove to commit suicide by overeating&mdash;an intention
frustrated by Allan, who removed the bowl
finally and took the kitten into his lap in front of the
fire. It seemed to have suddenly grown to twice its
size, and instead of the heart-rending mews, Allan heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a faint but enthusiastic purring as the poor little object
curled itself up in his arm and blinked its gratitude.
Presently it went fast asleep and, rather than disturb
it, Allan sat there for almost an hour, with his books
just out of reach.</p>

<p>That evening they named it. Tommy wanted something
patriotic: Erskine, he thought, was just the thing.
Hal showed the possession of an unsuspected streak of
sentiment and clamored for Hortense. Allan, recollecting
the fact that the mother’s name was Edith
Cinnamon, was in favor of calling the offspring Clove
or Nutmeg. But Pete, who had been gravely examining
the kitten at arm’s length, took his pipe from between
his lips, and with the stem tapped the two black
spots on its back.</p>

<p>“Two Spot,” he said, with finality.</p>

<p>Two Spot it was. And a few days later neither
of the others would have changed the name for any
consideration, since, as Tommy sadly expressed it,
“Poor old Pete had named her.”</p>

<p>That first day of December was memorable not only
for the arrival of Two Spot, but for the first gathering
at Pete’s club table. Of those beside our friends who
composed the table, it is not necessary to speak at any
length.</p>

<p>Poor we already know very slightly. Wolcott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Cooper, Van Sciver, and Maitland were average fellows
who had gained prestige for one reason or another,
among their companions. It was a fact that Pete had
succeeded in gathering together what might have been
called the pick of the freshman class. That he had
been able to do so was partly because of his tact and
powers of persuasion and partly because freshman club
tables were so seldom formed at Erskine that the
project had the flavor of the unusual.</p>

<p>Dinner was the first meal, and it was a very jolly
one. There were one or two introductions to be made,
and these Pete performed with his usual breeziness.
After that the eight members sat down, Pete thumped
the bell commandingly, and the table began its official
existence&mdash;an existence which endured for four college
years.</p>

<p>By the time the roast beef and vegetables made their
appearance the ice was very thoroughly broken. When
the cabinet-pudding and fruit came on, good-fellowship
reigned supreme, and long after the last plate had been
pushed aside the members still sat about the table, as
though loath to leave. It is doubtful if there was a
single one of them who did not, mentally at least, thank
Pete Burley for including him in his club table.</p>

<p>One gusty winter afternoon, four days later, Pete
appeared at Allan’s room at about three o’clock. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
wore his thickest sweater and a pair of woolen
gloves.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to see the Guilds. Want to come
along?”</p>

<p>“You know plaguey well I can’t,” said Allan, impatiently.
“I’ve got all this stuff to do.” He indicated
the litter of books and papers hopelessly. Somehow,
of late the Midyears had seemed perilously near.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I’ll tell ’em you said ‘How.’ I think
I’ll take a boat and row up.”</p>

<p>“You’ll what?” gasped Allan. “Why, it’s an easy
three miles by the river.”</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> all right; I feel like a little exercise.”</p>

<p>“You’re a chump if you do,” answered the other,
irritably. “How’ll you get the boat back?”</p>

<p>“I’ll let it stay there, maybe. Maybe I’ll come
back in it after dinner. It’s easy enough to get down-stream.”</p>

<p>“Not in the dark. You’ll drown your fool self.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not. Sorry you can’t come along.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” muttered Allan, as the door closed.
“Pete’s a perfect idiot lately.”</p>

<p>After dinner the wind increased into a very respectable
gale, and Allan fell to wondering whether
Pete would be fool enough to attempt the trip back
in the boat. At nine o’clock his uneasiness drove him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
forth. He fought his way down Main Street to Center,
and so around to Pete’s lodgings. Lights in the windows
reassured him, and he had half a mind to go
back to his studies, but after a moment’s indecision he
decided to go up for just a moment and tell Pete again
what an idiot he had been. So he climbed the stairs
and thrust open the door. At the table stood Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said, “I thought you were Pete.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he here?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“No; I don’t know where he is.”</p>

<p>“I do,” Allan replied. Tommy was plainly uneasy
when he learned of Pete’s trip. The two stayed
until almost eleven. Then, as Pete had not returned,
they went home together.</p>

<p>“He’s probably decided to stay there all night,”
said Allan, hopefully. “Like as not, they wouldn’t
let him come back.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s it,” answered Tommy. “Pete
wouldn’t be such a fool, anyhow, as to try and come
down the river on a night like this.”</p>

<p>But despite his words, Allan went to sleep feeling
not a little worried, and awoke the next morning with
a feeling of impending misfortune. Pete was not in
the dining-hall, but it was after eleven o’clock before
Allen had an opportunity to make inquiries. When
he did, he could find no news of his friend. No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had seen him that morning. Allan cut a recitation
and hurried down to Pete’s rooms. The bed had not
been occupied. Allan returned to the yard fighting
against fear.</p>

<p>At three he heard the news from Hal, who, white
of face, was waiting him on the porch.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s all up with p-poor old Pete,” he announced,
with his mouth working tremulously. “They
found the boat he had a mile down the river. It&mdash;it
was capsized!”</p>

<p>Allan felt his own face go pale, but after a moment
he muttered:</p>

<p>“Pete could swim like a fish; you know that.”</p>

<p>Hal shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then why hasn’t he showed up?” he asked, hopelessly.
“No, he’s a goner. You remember what he
said about premonitions and things going to happen
to him? I guess he was right, Allan. Poor old Pete!
They&mdash;they found his hat, too, down by the wharves.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>TOMMY CORRECTS A REPORT</small></h2>

<p>Allan was almost the last of Pete’s friends to give
up hope; but when, by the next morning, Pete had
neither returned nor had news of him been received,
even Allan accepted the general belief. The janitor
at the boat-house readily identified the overturned boat,
while as for the hat, which had washed ashore at the
foot of Main Street, even if Allan and Hal had been
in doubt about it, there was still Pete’s initials marked
on the inside. Inquiry at Hillcrest had elicited the
information that Pete had never reached there.</p>

<p>The Guilds were deeply concerned, and Mr. Guild
not only added a sum to that offered by the college
for the recovery of the body, but himself took charge
of a boat which all the next day dragged the river
between his place and Centerport. The drowned body,
however, was never recovered&mdash;a fact which surprised
nobody, since the current is capricious, and the stream
so broad as to preclude the possibility of searching
every foot of its bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The accepted theory was that Pete had encountered
a sudden squall while crossing the river which had
either swamped the boat or overturned it. Although
Pete was known to have been a capable swimmer and
a fellow of more than ordinary strength, yet the fact
that he had failed to win the shore from midstream,
weighted down as he had been with heavy clothing,
was not considered strange.</p>

<p>A telegram was at once despatched to Pete’s father
in Colorado, and, since that did not elicit a reply by
the following forenoon, a second message was sent. The
death was announced in the city papers with much
detail, and Pete’s athletic prowess was highly exaggerated.
The Erskine Purple, which appeared the second
day after the accident, contained a half-column notice
of the sad affair, in which Pete’s many estimable qualities
were feelingly set forth. Tommy wrote the notice
himself, and, as he felt every word he wrote, the article
was a very touching tribute.</p>

<p>The club table was a subdued and sorrowful place
for several days. Pete’s chair stood pathetically empty
until, in desperation, Allan put it away. But as a
head to the table was essential, an informal election
was taken two days after Pete’s disappearance, and
Wolcott was elevated to the place of honor. A meeting
of the freshman class was called and a committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was appointed to draw up resolutions of sorrow, to be
sent to Pete’s father and to be published in the Purple.</p>

<p>When, after the second day of search, the tug-boat
commissioned by the college to drag for the body abandoned
its work, the first depression had passed and the
college by degrees returned to its usual spirits. But
Allan and Hal and Tommy were not so speedily resigned.
Tommy, in especial, took the event hard.</p>

<p>Perhaps it had been the utter dissimilarity of Pete’s
nature and his own which had drawn him to Pete.
That as may be, Tommy was a very grave-faced little
chap in those days.</p>

<p>But Allan, if he showed less grief, was sadly depressed.
He had not realized before how much he had
grown to care in six weeks for the big, good-hearted
Westerner. He felt terribly lonely, and besides he
blamed himself for not having accompanied Pete;
perhaps, he thought dolefully, had he gone along, the
accident wouldn’t have happened, and Pete would have
been sitting there now across the table, puffing lazily
at his evil-smelling corn-cob pipe. But instead of Pete
there was only Tommy and Hal&mdash;and Two Spot.</p>

<p>Two Spot, grown greatly in bulk since her advent,
was snuggled against Tommy’s arm. Outside it was
blowing a gale and lashing the rain against the long
windows. It was a most depressing afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the spirits of the three friends were at a low ebb.
Tommy looked now and then as though a good cry
would do him worlds of good. Hal scowled morosely
and drummed irritatingly on the arm of the Morris
chair until Allan, in desperation, begged him to “cut
it out.” It was at this juncture that Tommy let fall
a remark that set Allan thinking hard.</p>

<p>“Poor old Pete got what he was after, though,
didn’t he?” asked Tommy, breaking a silence of several
minutes’ duration.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember the bet he and I made?”
Tommy replied. “Well, he got his name on the first
page of the Purple, after all. Wish he hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Hal. “I’d forgotten about that
bet. I guess you’ll have to pay that wager to us,
Tommy, and we’ll drink to Pete’s memory.”</p>

<p>Allan, his heart thumping wildly, looked at the
other fellows’ faces, but it was quite evident that the
wild surmise which had come to him had not occurred
to them. He pushed back his chair abruptly and went
to the window.</p>

<p>Was it possible? he asked himself. Surely, Pete
would not have gone to such a length merely to win
a bet! And yet&mdash;Pete was Pete; what another fellow
would do was no criterion when it came to Pete’s conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Allan’s heart was racing and thumping now.
The more he considered the affair in the light of
Tommy’s remark the more plausible seemed the startling
theory which had assailed him. He turned to
blurt out his suspicions to the others, then hesitated.
If he should prove to be wrong, he would regret charging
Pete with such madness. Perhaps he had better
keep his own counsel for a while longer.</p>

<p>To you, respected reader, who have all along known,
or at least suspected, the truth of the matter, it probably
seems strange that Allan should not have instantly
realized the hoax. I have no explanation to offer in his
behalf. He was still in doubt when Fate, in the not
uncommon semblance of a postman, came to his relief.</p>

<p>When he answered the landlady’s tap on his door,
he received a letter the mere sight of which set all
his doubts at rest. The envelope was postmarked
Hastings&mdash;Hastings is a small city eighteen miles
down the river from Centerport&mdash;and the round,
schoolboy writing was unmistakably Pete’s.</p>

<p>Tommy and Hal glanced around when the door
opened, but paid no attention while Allan tore open
the envelope and rushed through the two pages of
writing inside. They only awoke to the fact that
something had happened when Allan, waving the sheet
above his head, gave vent to a blood-curdling yell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
joy that sent Two Spot scuttling out of Tommy’s arms
and under the dresser.</p>

<p>“What is it?” they cried in unison.</p>

<p>Allan waved the letter again ecstatically.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter from him!”</p>

<p>“Him? Who?”</p>

<p>“<em>Pete!</em>”</p>

<p>To attempt to describe the subsequent confusion
would be absurd. Only a wide-awake phonograph
could do it. Two chairs were overturned, Tommy
screeched, Hal roared, Allan yelled back. The letter
waved in air. Then Tommy danced an impromptu
jig and, being quite unconscious that he was doing it,
did it with much grace. Unfortunately none noticed
it. Hal was struggling for the letter. Allan was
fighting to keep possession of it. Tommy danced on.
Occasionally he shrieked. His shriek was not nearly
so pleasant as his dancing. After many moments comparative
quiet settled and three breathless fellows gathered
at the window while Allan, holding the precious
document in his hands, read aloud. This is what they
heard, leaving out, for the sake of clearness, the frequent
interpolations of the listeners:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hastings House, Hastings</span>, <i>Dec. 7, 1903</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allan</span>&mdash;I guess you weren’t fooled, but anyhow
it may be best, in case you are getting worried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to write and let you know that I am still alive and
kicking like a steer. I would have written before, but
only got a copy of the Purp this morning. It was
fine. Tell Tommy he did nobly. I know it was
Tommy wrote it because of the poetry. I’m going to
have that front page framed for my descendants to
look upon. They’ll know then what a noble youth
I was.</p>

<p>I’m leaving here for New York to-night. The old
man’s there. I’m not stuck on telling him about it,
you can bet. He will be rip-snorting mad. I had
to drown myself when I did because I got a letter
saying he was going to be in New York a couple of
weeks, and I knew he wouldn’t get any telegrams or
things announcing my sad death. I don’t guess they’ll
let me come back to college, and I don’t care very much,
except that I hate to say good-by to you and Hal and
Tommy. But I’ll see you again before I go home,
unless they are easy on me, which doesn’t seem likely,
does it?</p>

<p>You see, I rowed up to Harwich, turned the boat
over and set it adrift, and tossed my hat after it.
I had another inside my coat. Then I walked to
Williamsport and took the train back to this place.
I’ve been here ever since. It’s a dull hole. But I
had to wait for the Purple to make sure I hadn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
slipped up. I suppose there was a lot of trouble. I’m
sorry if I worried you fellows, but life was getting
duller than ditch-water and something had to be done.
I wish you would go down to my room and pack up
the things that are lying around.</p>

<p>Tell Tommy I’ll come back some day for that dinner,
and that it’s got to be a good one. Maybe, if you
have time, you’ll write and tell me how you all are.
It seems like I hadn’t seen you for a month. Address
me, Care Thomas A. Burley, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New
York. You fellows have got to come out to Colorado
this summer and visit me if they don’t let me come
back to college. If you don’t, I’ll arise from my watery
grave and haunt you. Say “How” to Hal and Tommy,
and don’t forget your poor old</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Uncle Pete</span>.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The news astonished everybody save the Dean, who
had already begun to smell a rat. Astonishment gave
place to relief or joy, according to the hearer’s degree
of intimacy with Pete, and joy gave place to resentment.
It is rather annoying to lavish regret over the
taking-off of a friend only to discover that the friend
has worked a deliberate hoax on you and is still alive
to enjoy your confusion. That is why, had Pete put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in an appearance at Erskine at that time, he would
in all probability have been mobbed.</p>

<p>But Pete didn’t appear, and ultimately resentment
gave place to amusement. The general attitude became
one of laughing disapproval. After all, Pete was Pete,
and even if he had harrowed their feelings considerably
at the same time he had supplied interest at a dull
season and had worked nobody any harm. This reasoning
may have appealed to the faculty as well. At
all events, their verdict, when announced, was thought
to be amazingly merciful. Peter Burley ’07 was suspended
for the balance of the term. As there remained
less than four weeks of the term, the penalty would
be of short duration.</p>

<p>Allan and Hal were delighted, and even Tommy,
after the first day or two of rampant rage, grudgingly
acknowledged that he was glad Pete was coming back.
This was also after Tommy had written a denial for
the Purple of that paper’s announcement of Pete’s
death. That denial was very, very simple and brief.
There was no mention made of Pete’s many excellent
qualities, nor did it express exuberant joy over his
restoration. It merely stated that the announcement
had proved erroneous and that Mr. Peter Burley was
visiting relatives in New York city.</p>

<p>When Allan or Hal mentioned that announcement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Tommy went purple in the face and fell to stuttering.
Perhaps, as Allan pointed out, it was just as well he
stuttered, since what he had to say was really unfit
for polite ears. But Tommy’s anger was too intense
to last, and by the middle of the month he was able
to smile wanly at Pete’s deception. The awarding to
him of a two-hundred-dollar scholarship helped, perhaps,
to restore his good humor. Hal said the scholarship
would come in very handy in paying for the
dinner.</p>

<p>Pete wrote that he had heard the faculty’s verdict,
and was glad they were going to let him come back.
He was leaving New York for home as he wrote, to
be gone until the opening of the winter term. By
reading between the lines, Allan surmised that Pete’s
father had not been over-much pleased with his son’s
escapade; there were signs of a chastened spirit.</p>

<p>The term wore itself to a close, and one sunshiny
morning Allan and Hal and Tommy left Centerport
for their respective homes, traveling the first part of
the journey in company. Two Spot, apparently indifferent
to the separation, was confided to Mrs. Purdy,
and spent the Christmas holidays in the neighborhood
of the kitchen range.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>PETE WRITES HOME</small></h2>


<p>“Of course,” said Allan, “we’re not terribly poor,
but it’s going to make a good deal of difference to us.”</p>

<p>The new term was three days old and Allan and
Pete were sitting in front of the stove in Pete’s study.
The stove was a recent addition to the furnishings,
and installed more in deference to his friends’ demands
than from any desire of his own. Pete didn’t mind
a little cold; just so long as he could find enough water
under the ice in the pitcher to wash with, he was
satisfied. But Allan and Hal and Tommy made disparaging
remarks about his heating arrangements and
ostentatiously kept their hats and coats on while visiting
him, and so Pete bought a base-burner and a half
ton of coal.</p>

<p>“What mine is it?” asked Pete.</p>

<p>“The Gold Beetle. Ever hear of it? It’s out in
your State.”</p>

<p>“Is it at Rico?” asked Pete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the place. Didn’t you say you were
there last summer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know&mdash;something about the mine.”
Pete looked thoughtfully at the flames dancing behind
the mica. “Fact is,” he continued, “the old man is
interested in it.”</p>

<p>“Really? Then don’t you think it will be all
right? He wouldn’t have anything to do with a poor
mine, would he?”</p>

<p>“Well, the trouble is you can’t always tell whether
a mine’s good or bad. The old man’s got stock in all
kinds; some of it’s good, some of it isn’t worth the
paper it’s printed on. I’ve got a lot of that kind
myself. I used to think I was something of an investor.
Now, this Gold Beetle; what’s probably happened
to that is that the pay ore has given out. It
very often does. A mine’ll run thousands to the ton
for two or three years, sometimes twenty, and then
all of a sudden the lode will just naturally peter out.
I guess that’s what’s happened to the Beetle. I remember
pretty well how it lies. There are paying properties
all around it, and maybe if they went on or opened
up new drifts they’d come across fresh lodes; or maybe
they wouldn’t; it’s just a gamble. I dare say the
stockholders aren’t willing to put any money into it.
How much stock do your folks hold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. Pretty nearly half of it,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! I’ll ask the old man, when I write,
what he thinks about it.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. Maybe if he owns some of it
we could&mdash;could kind of get together and&mdash;and do
something,” said Allan, vaguely but hopefully.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Pete, thoughtfully. “Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile I’ve got to find some way of making
a little money; enough to pay my board, at any rate.
And that’s why I ought to leave the table, Pete, and
go back to commons, where I can feed for less.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t let you do that. Now, look here;
you don’t eat very much. What’s the sense in your
paying as much as I do, who eat twice as much? That’s
plumb foolish! I ought to pay at least eight dollars
and you oughtn’t to pay a red cent over four; and
that’s the way it’s going to be after this.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” Allan replied. “If I stay, I’ll pay
my share, and that’s six dollars, Pete. I went over
yesterday to see if I couldn’t get a place in Brown
Hall as a waiter, but there aren’t any vacancies; they
told me they had two applications for every place.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t like to wait on table, would
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t a question of liking. I’ve heard tell of
lots of ways of earning money in college, but none of
them seem very practical for my case.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here; you figure out how much money
you’ll need for the rest of the year and let me know.”</p>

<p>Allan looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“What good would that do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend it to you. Now, shut up! I haven’t
offered to give it to you, have I, you chump? You
can pay me back any time you like; there isn’t a bit
of a hurry. And I’ve got a whole lot of money in
bank from last term. Somehow, it’s mighty hard to
get rid of money up here. You needn’t say anything
to any one about it; it’ll just be between you and me.
That’s all right, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t all right, Pete, but it’s awfully good
of you, and I won’t forget it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>And although Pete threatened and coaxed and
called names, he was at last forced to abandon the
proposition. And in the end it was Tommy who,
learning of Allan’s quandary, made the suggestion
which led to a measure of success.</p>

<p>“I knew a fellow at school who used to go around
to the fellows’ rooms at night and sell sandwiches and
wienerwursts and made good money,” said Tommy.
“Wouldn’t care for that, though, I guess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Allan acknowledged that he wouldn’t.</p>

<p>“Then there was a fellow I heard of who was
agent for a sporting-goods firm and sold on commission.
He worked up quite a trade, but it took him a good
while to do it. Then there was a fellow had a rental
business: rented rooms and got a commission from the
landladies; but he did most of his business in the fall.
Then&mdash;” Tommy paused, struck by a brilliant thought.
“You might try for a place on the Purple,” he
cried. “They elect new men in March. If you got
a place, you’d make fair money from March on to the
end of the year. That’s what I did last year, and I
made enough to pay my board.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know anything about reporting,
Tommy,” Allan objected. “Besides, I’m not a hustler
like you.”</p>

<p>Tommy looked disappointed. He thought for a
minute in silence. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“I tell you, Allan,” he said, “I’ll see Stearns.
He’s track-team captain, you know. I’ll tell him that
if you don’t find something to do, you won’t be able
to stay here. And he won’t want to lose you, you
can bet, because he’s set his heart on winning from
Robinson this spring.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know that that would be quite true,”
Allan objected. “Because, even if I don’t find any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
work, maybe I’ll be able to hang on here somehow to
the end of the year.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t lie to him,” said Tommy, “but
I’ll fix him so he’ll find something; you see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>He lifted Two Spot off his lap and deposited her
on the desk, where she subsided contentedly against a
pile of books and purred on as though nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>“Happy little bunch of fur, isn’t she?” asked
Tommy. “If she’s too great an expense to you, I’ll
take her off your hands.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you’ll not!” answered Allan. “While
there’s a loaf left in the house, she shall have the
crust.”</p>

<p>“Scratch him, Kitty! Say, did Pete tell you he’d
gone out for the freshman hockey team? Won’t he
be a sight on the ice?”</p>

<p>“He says he can skate,” answered Allan. “All
I know is, I don’t want to have the thingamabob&mdash;puck&mdash;when
he’s bearing down on me.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to play?”</p>

<p>“No; I’d like to, but I guess I won’t have time.
Besides, I don’t skate very well.”</p>

<p>“Skating isn’t everything in hockey,” said Tommy,
wisely. “I can skate myself. I can make the ice
look like a picture in a book or a map of China; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
last year, when I went out for the freshman team, I
was nearly slaughtered. Leroy butted me into the
boards and somebody else cracked me over the shins
with his stick and another chap tripped me up&mdash;accidentally,
<em>of</em> course&mdash;and I slid thirty-one feet or thereabouts
on my head. The hair didn’t grow back for a
month. I quit. Life was too precious.”</p>

<p>“Wise youth!” commented Allan. “But we
mustn’t miss seeing Pete play. Let’s go over to the
rink to-morrow, if there is any ice.”</p>

<p>“All right. And I guess there’ll be ice; it’s cold
enough now to freeze a door-knob. Going down to
Pete’s this evening? I’ll see you there, then. So long.
Good-by, Two Spot, my angel child!”</p>

<p>Tommy’s plan bore fruit. Allan had a visit from
Walter Stearns next day, and two days later Allan
was giving two hours out of each twenty-four to
clerical work in the office of the Erskine College Athletic
Association.</p>

<p>The work, which consisted chiefly of answering
letters from Professor Nast’s dictation&mdash;Professor Nast
was chairman of the Athletic Committee&mdash;was ridiculously
easy, if somewhat uninteresting, and seemed out
of all proportion to the remuneration, which was one
dollar an hour. There were five working days in the
week for Allan, and as a result he was earning ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
dollars a week&mdash;twice as much as he had hoped for.
And all the time he was disturbed by a haunting
thought that, when all was said and done, he was not
really earning the money. But it seemed absurd to
find fault with his good fortune so long as his employers
were satisfied, and so he offered no objections.
Afterwards he marveled at his blindness.</p>

<p>About this time Pete wrote one of his semi-occasional
letters to his father. He wasn’t much of a
letter-writer, and the epistle as a whole would not
interest us, but a portion of it merits attention.</p>

<p>“I remember (he wrote) that you said in New
York you’d been down town to a meeting of the Gold
Beetle stockholders, and that they had voted to stop
work on the mine. I didn’t know then that Allan’s
folks were interested in it. I guess they haven’t dismantled
yet, and so it isn’t too late to change your
mind. I guess you have enough stock in it to control
it; if you haven’t, the Wares’ shares will give you the
whip-hand. I want you to have them go ahead with
the Gold Beetle and fuss round some. A couple of
months’ work won’t break anybody. You can charge
your share of it up to me. There must be pay ore
somewhere on the property. Look at all the gold that’s
coming out all around it. Allan’s folks need the
money. It’s about all the income they have. If that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
stops, his sister will have to give up her college, and
so will Allan. Allan’s my side partner, and I’m not
going to have him lose what property he has without
another try. Let me know right away about this.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>HOCKEY&mdash;WITH VARIATIONS</small></h2>


<p>Allan, Tommy, and Hal stood at the side of the
rink, up to their ankles in snow, and watched Pete
play hockey. The rink was built at the far end of
Erskine Field, and looked, from the locker house, like
a brand-new cattle-pen.</p>

<p>This Saturday afternoon it was snowing in a half-hearted
way, making the ice slushy and hiding the
town from view. There were about fifty other fellows
looking on, for the Midyears had begun, and anything
to take the mind off examinations was welcome. The
varsity team had traveled down the river to play Hastings
High School, and the freshman team was making
the most of its opportunities.</p>

<p>There were only twelve candidates present, and so
the opposing teams each lacked a forward. But in
spite of this the play was fast and furious, making up
in enthusiasm what it lacked in science. Pete was
playing cover-point on the first team, and thus far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his performance had not lacked of applause. If some
of the applause was unmistakably sarcastic, still it
was applause.</p>

<p>Pete was a hard skater and very much at home
on the ice, but there wasn’t much of grace about him.
He hadn’t as yet learned the subtleties of stick-handling,
but he usually managed to get the puck by the
simple expedient of skating full-tilt against the opponent
and knocking him down in a good-natured, inoffensive
way. Allan, Tommy, and Hal felt, as they
watched, that they were being fully rewarded for
tramping out there through the snow.</p>

<p>“Let’s see you skate backward, Pete,” called Allan
in a lull of the game. Pete grinned.</p>

<p>“Give us the grape-vine, Pete,” begged Tommy.
Pete grinned again.</p>

<p>“How are you on the outer-edge, old man?” asked
Hal. Pete continued to grin.</p>

<p>Then the puck came sliding down toward him,
dribbled this way and that by the hockey of an opposing
forward. Pete drew himself together, grasped his
stick in both hands as though it was a bludgeon, and
rushed toward the foe. Down went the foe, and the
three admirers laughed joyfully. But Pete didn’t get
the puck, for the vanquished one had succeeded in
passing it across to another forward, exhibiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
first suggestion of team-play of the afternoon, so far
as the second team was concerned, and Pete skated
wildly in pursuit. The point went out to meet the
attack, another clever pass was made, and then&mdash;
Presto! goal was shaking his head and pulling the
disk out from under the netting. The second had
scored.</p>

<p>“Ah, that was great work, Pete!” cried Allan,
admiringly.</p>

<p>“That was <em>playing</em>!” said Hal. “Oh, it was
great!”</p>

<p>“Real science, <em>I</em> call it!” declared Tommy.
“How’d you do it, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mind their scoring, Pete,” said Allan,
encouragingly. “You knocked your man down. Just
you kill all you want to.”</p>

<p>Pete skated over and scattered them with his
hockey.</p>

<p>“You wait till I get these skates off,” he threatened,
“and I’ll roll you three little snipes in the
snow!”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste your strength on us, Pete,” begged
Tommy from a safe distance. “Slaughter the enemy.
Don’t be discouraged; there’s only six left.”</p>

<p>“Eat ’em up, Pete!” cried Hal.</p>

<p>Pete shook his stick at them and turned away. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he skated back to his position a chorus of admiring
“A-a-ahs!” followed him. When the second half was
almost done the score was 5 to 6, in the first team’s
favor, and the captain of the second, a big, round-faced
chap who played center, called on his support for a
goal.</p>

<p>“Play hard, fellows, and let’s tie this!” he commanded.
“Play together now!”</p>

<p>Fortune seemed to be favoring them. They secured
the rubber and swept with it down the rink. As usual,
Pete put one man out of the play, but by the time he
had recovered from the check the advance was past him
and was threatening the goal. Both teams were mixed
in wild confusion, and the puck was carroming about
from goal to attack and from attack to defense. Then
it was sped knee-high at the net, was luckily stopped
by the goal, and shot out to the side right at Pete’s
feet.</p>

<p>Pete started off with it, but was in such a hurry
that he overskated, and had to fight for it. When he
again secured possession the attack was thick about
him. But he started off again, and the forwards of
his side skated to their positions. Pete kept close to
the boards, fooled the opposing cover-point by carroming
the puck against them, and for an instant had a
clear shot at goal. But shooting wasn’t Pete’s specialty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and so he charged on until, well past the center of the
ice, the second team’s captain charged him fiercely from
the side, hurling him against the boards and knocking
his stick into the air.</p>

<p>Luckily, the puck struck the adversary’s skate and
carromed back to the side, and Pete, thrusting his skate
against it, held it there while the other pushed and
shoved with his body and tried to work the puck loose
with his stick. About them hovered friend and foe,
awaiting the instant when the disk should slide out of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>The second-team player fought like mad and at
last, by a fierce shove, moved Pete’s foot. <a href="#image04">Pete</a>, fearing
loss of the precious prize, swung quickly around,
bringing his adversary to the boards, and then, catching
him with one hand at the knee, <a href="#image04">tipped him over the
barrier</a> into the soft snow.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_143">Pete tipped him over the barrier.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Without waiting to see him safely landed, Pete
rescued the puck from an interloping enemy and went
straight down the rink with it, scorning friend and foe
alike, and drove it furiously into goal. When he swung
around and looked back, it seemed that a devastating
gale had swept over the rink, for along his route first-team
men and second-team men were picking themselves
up from the ice. But what surprised him more
was the appearance of the second’s captain, who, snow-covered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
black of face and scowling, was swaggering
up to him.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?” he growled.</p>

<p>From the sides of the rink came shouts of laughter.
Allan, Hal, and Tommy were hanging feebly over the
barrier, beating the planks with their hands in gasping
impotence.</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Pete, plainly at a loss.</p>

<p>“Throw me over the boards,” answered the other,
belligerently.</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” asked Pete. “Why, you were in my
way, you see.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have done that, Burley,” said the
first team’s captain. “But you needn’t try and scrap
here on the ice,” he continued, turning to the other.
“Play the game!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Pete, “wasn’t that all right?
Mustn’t I do that?”</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t. You ought to know the
rules. The puck goes back there again.” The first’s
captain turned away impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s on me, partner,” said Pete. “Sorry, and
hope I didn’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” muttered the other, as graciously as
he could. The knowledge that he had served as a
source of intense amusement prevented him from putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
much cordiality into his tones. The puck was
taken back to where Pete had transgressed the rules,
and again faced off by him and the second’s captain.
The latter got possession and the play went on, but to
the onlookers it was very dull, and none cared when,
after a minute or two, the game came to an end.</p>

<p>Allan, Hal, and Tommy, still very red of face and
still grinning, awaited Pete and escorted him back to
the college in triumph, Hal marching ahead and chanting
an improvised pæan of praise until Pete seized him
and rolled him over in the snow. Thereupon Hal
retired to a safe distance and threw snowballs at Pete.
He was not, however, a very good shot and, as a result,
Tommy and Allan were hit more often than their companion.
It ended with the three joining forces against
the obnoxious Hal and chasing him all the way down
Poplar Street.</p>

<p>When he reached Mrs. Purdy’s, in his retreat, he
withdrew into Allan’s room, locked the door, and sent
Two Spot, a white handkerchief tied around her neck,
out by way of a window, to treat with the besiegers.
The flag of truce was respected. Hal opened the window
and agreed to surrender if allowed to march forth
from the citadel with colors flying, and his terms were
accepted. He retired from view and presently reappeared
in Allan’s plaid dressing-gown, and holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
aloft a Hillton flag. Silently and proudly he marched
forth and twice paraded the piazza. Then the enemy,
violating the rules of warfare, fell upon him as one
man, and he was borne, struggling and kicking, back
into the citadel and deposited on the couch.</p>

<p>Allan returned to the front yard and rescued his
handkerchief, which was trailing in the snow as Two
Spot chased an imaginary mouse around the bare and
solitary rose-bush. Tommy had meanwhile poked the
fire into a blaze, and victors and vanquished drew up
to it, while Pete smoked the pipe of peace and the
others ate sweet chocolate, which, as Tommy pointed
out, represented the fruits of victory.</p>

<p>Two Spot sat on Pete’s broad knee and purred and
blinked at the flames and occasionally stuck her claws
tentatively through Pete’s trousers as a proof of her
affection. And everybody felt very jolly and comfortable
until the six-o’clock bell sent them to prepare for
dinner.</p>

<small>IN THE “CORRAL”</small></h2>


<p>While the snow kept piling itself up and the Midyears
were still racking fellows’ brains, the call came
for candidates for the relay team to run against Robinson
at the Boston indoor meeting. And simultaneously
the outdoor track was shoveled free of snow and
fellows whose ambitions pointed toward the winning
of pewter mugs trotted out in the afternoons, when the
mercury was down to zero, and sped around the track
with their bare legs looking very pink and cold. Kernahan
had induced Allan to enter for both the mile
and the two mile, and the latter was one of the most
indefatigable of those who daily risked death by
freezing.</p>

<p>He was glad to be able to stretch his legs again,
was Allan. He had begun to wonder whether the muscles
hadn’t forgotten how to work. He had his first
mile trial a week after the beginning of practise and
a fortnight before the date of the meeting.</p>

<p>The result wasn’t especially satisfactory; 4:56<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was not anywhere near record time for that track, while
it was more than twenty seconds slower than what it
must be to give him a chance at winning a place. But
Kernahan seemed in nowise discouraged. Instead, he
told Allan he had done well enough for a starter, and
promised to give him a trial at the two miles a week
later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the relay candidates were tested and
sifted, the candidates for the field events practised
daily in the gymnasium, and athletic activity seized
upon the college. The baseball cage resounded with
the thump of the balls and the cries of the players, the
rowing-room gave forth strange sounds of an afternoon,
and the basket-ball team, undisputed lords of the gymnasium
floor for two months, were hustled into a corner
and given scant attention.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all these hints, Winter was
strangely dense. Instead of folding up his blanket
of snow and taking himself off, he showed no sign of
contemplated departure, but on the contrary tightened
his icy grip on the world, and almost every day sent
a new snow-storm to emphasize the fact that he still
reigned.</p>

<p>Afternoon practise on the track took place in every
sort of weather. Sometimes it snowed so hard that the
runners, as they swept around the far end of the track,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
were only indistinct blurs in the white mist. Sometimes
the track was sheeted with a rough skim of ice,
through which the men’s spikes broke imperfectly, and
on such days the spills were numerous and the turns
were things to be carefully negotiated. Sometimes the
sun shone and the wind blew, straight and cold, out
of the northeast; and such times were best, deluding
one for a while, as they did, into thinking that winter’s
sway was drawing to its end. But they were deceitful
moments, and one could fancy old Winter shaking his
lean sides with laughter as he drew the clouds together
again and emptied a new shower of flakes upon the
bleak world.</p>

<p>But matters progressed. The relay team of six
runners was formed, the sprinters and distance men
worked themselves into condition, and the hurdlers,
jumpers, vaulters, and weight men limbered up their
muscles.</p>

<p>A week before the meeting Allan was given a speed
trial for the two miles. The track was in fairly good
condition, and Rindgely and Thatcher made the pace.
With Allan was another two-mile candidate, named
Conroy. Allan took the lead at the start and held it
for the first half mile. Rindgely went in then and
made the pace for the next three-quarters, and then
gave place to Thatcher, a half-miler. Conroy was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
lap behind at the half distance, and at the finish was
entirely out of it. Allan found his sprinting ability
sorely tried in the last two laps when Thatcher let
himself out and Allan tried to keep up with him. But
he finished fairly strong, and Kernahan slipped his
watch into his pocket with a nod of approval.</p>

<p>“Ten, one and an eighth,” he said.</p>

<p>But that seemed slow time to Allan, who had entertained
visions of doing the distance in something like
9:50, and he said so to Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good enough to give you a chance of
a place,” he answered. “You’ve got three months yet
before the dual meet, and Robinson’s best two-miler
could only do&mdash;9:46, I think it was. You’ll get some
experience at the Boston meet, if you don’t bring home
a mug, and experience is what you need. You’ll have
to get into your pace sooner down there or you’ll get
crowded off the track. You try half a dozen starts
Monday and try getting your pace in the first six or
eight strides. You’d better run along now, and don’t
be scarey of the cold water, my boy.”</p>

<p>During that next week the class hockey championship
was decided. The freshmen won handily from
the sophomores by the score of seven goals to three in
the first of the contests, and to Pete went the credit
for four of the seven goals. He played magnificently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>To be sure, as has been said already, he knew little
of the science of the game, but what he lacked there
he made up in vigor and enthusiasm. Thrice he was
put off the ice for short periods, but this only caused
him to work harder when he was allowed to re-enter
the game. In the second half&mdash;the first period having
ended with the score three to four in favor of ’07&mdash;he
was played up into the forward line, and when he
secured the puck and once got away with it, it was his
until he had shot at the sophomores’ goal. If Pete had
been able to shoot as well as he skated and dodged the
enemy, the score would have been overwhelming.</p>

<p>But Pete’s Waterloo came when the deciding game
was contested with ’04. Pete’s playing was just as
hard and fast as before, but the seniors had two or
three players who, in the language of Tommy, “made
rings around him.” Every time Pete tried one of his
sensational rushes, some one or other of the discourteous
enemy, carefully avoiding his body, stole the puck from
under his nose. Pete endured it for a while untroubled,
then he began to break hockeys. But the supply seemed
unlimited, and the remedy wasn’t successful. Defeat
fell to ’07’s share.</p>

<p>They tried to tease Pete on the afternoon’s performance
that evening, but Pete was invulnerable to
gibes. The four had congregated in the “corral” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
were hugging the stove closely, Pete sitting astride the
stock saddle which, for want of a chair, he had lugged
from its corner.</p>

<p>“Must have cost you something for sticks,” Tommy
suggested.</p>

<p>“Must have cost the other fellows something,”
laughed Hal. “I saw Rindgely lose three. You were
a destructive chap, Pete.”</p>

<p>“Rindgely was plumb crazy,” answered Pete, with
a broad smile. “Every time he got a new stick, I
bust it for him. I don’t just know whether that’s good
hockey, but I know it worked mighty well. But
Rindgely’s got it in for me, all right.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have it in for me too,” said Allan,
thoughtfully. “The other day he didn’t want to make
pace for me when I tried the two miles, and acted nasty
as you like afterward in the locker house.”</p>

<p>“He’s a queer customer,” said Tommy. “A pretty
good fellow to keep away from. I don’t mean that
there’s anything wrong with him, you know, but he’s
awfully uncertain. You never can tell how he’s going
to take a thing. Just after recess I met him one day,
and asked him if he’d taken in the St. Thomas Club
Indoor Meet&mdash;he lives in Brooklyn, you know&mdash;and
he nearly took my head off; said he wasn’t home Christmas,
and implied that it was none of my business. I
told him I didn’t care a rap where he was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right, Tommy; don’t you let them monkey
with you,” laughed Allan.</p>

<p>“Well, what did he want to jump on me for?”
asked Tommy, warmly. “I didn’t care whether he
went to the old meet or not; I just wanted to be polite.
The reason I mentioned the meet was that he’d told
about going the year before while he was at home, and
I just happened to remember seeing something about
it before Christmas. It’s an open meeting, you know,
and they have a big card&mdash;weights, team races, boxing,
and all sorts of stunts.”</p>

<p>“What is he, a miler?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>Tommy nodded.</p>

<p>“Guess that explains his cutting up with you,
Allan; you beat him in the fall, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with a good big handicap.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s afraid you’re going to cut him out of
a place in the dual meet.”</p>

<p>“There’s no good reason why he should think so.
He can beat me, I’m pretty sure. Besides, if Billy
Kernahan has his way, I’ll be down only for the two
miles at the dual.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a dandy article on the indoor
meeting this week,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Wrote it yourself, eh?” suggested Hal.</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be like last year’s, though,”
Tommy continued, ruefully. “We had two columns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
with everything figured out finely: who was going to
do what, and which fellows would win places. And then
it came out all wrong.”</p>

<p>“Say, Thomas,” said Pete, when the laughter had
subsided, “I don’t want to hurry you, but I’m getting
the powerful hungers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tommy, how about that dinner at the Elm
Tree?” chimed in Hal.</p>

<p>“He’s making money to pay for it,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” answered Tommy, sadly. “That’s
the trouble. You’ll have to wait a bit, Pete; I’m dead
broke, honest Injun!”</p>

<p>“All right; just so long as I get that feed. Better
not put it off too long, though; I’m nicely conditioned,
you know, since the Midyears, and there’s no telling
what may happen to me.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Allan said. “A fellow that’s been
drowned, suspended, and put on probation, all in two
short months, is a pretty slippery customer.”</p>

<p>“Say, Allan,” said Tommy, reminiscently, “do you
remember the night we waited up here for that duffer
to come home?”</p>

<p>“The night he was drowned?” asked Allan.
“Never’ll forget it. The way the wind howled and
cut up was a caution; made me think of graveyards
and&mdash;and corpses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Tommy. “I went back to the
room and dreamed of Pete floating in my bath-tub,
with his old smelly pipe in his mouth and his face all
white and horrid. Every time he puffed on the pipe
he winked his eye at me, and I woke up yelling like
a good one.” Tommy arose from his seat and stood
gazing into the flames. “It was a beast of a dream.”</p>

<p>“Must have been,” Hal responded, sympathetically.
Pete puffed silently at the afore-mentioned pipe and
grinned heartlessly. Tommy glanced over at him and
commenced an aimless ramble about the room.</p>

<p>“I said then,” he went on, “that if Pete&mdash; Say,
it’s getting beastly hot in here. Let’s have the door
open.”</p>

<p>In spite of the protests, he opened the portal into
the narrow hallway, and continued his rambling and
his talk.</p>

<p>“I made up my mind then that if Pete wasn’t
drowned, that if I ever saw his dear, foolish, homely
face again, I’d&mdash;I’d&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be a better man,” Hal suggested.</p>

<p>“Learn to write English,” offered Allan.</p>

<p>“Pay your debts,” muttered Pete over his pipe-stem.</p>

<p>“<em>I’d take a fall out of him!</em>” concluded Tommy,
savagely. At the same instant he put a hand under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Pete’s chin, tipped him heels over head backward onto
the floor, smothered his outcries by banging the saddle
down over his face, punched him twice in the ribs&mdash;and
flew! His forethought in opening the door saved
him. As he dived through he slammed it behind him
in Pete’s face, and the others heard four wild leaps on
the staircase. Then all was still save for Pete’s
chuckles. But stay! What sound was that from
beneath the window; what doleful wailings broke upon
the night air? They hearkened.</p>

<p>“Cowardy, cowardy, cowardy cat!” shrilled Tommy.
“Dare you to come down, Pete Burley!”</p>

<p>Pete threw up a front window. There was a sound
of hasty footfalls and an exclamation as Tommy collided
with an ash-barrel. Then from far up the street
came a last defiant challenge: “<em>O Fresh!</em>”</p>

<small>THE INDOOR MEETING</small></h2>


<p>Mechanics’ Hall, Boston, was filled from floor
to gallery, from doors to stage. The hum of voices,
the fluttering of programs, the slow bellow of the announcer
as, with megaphone at mouth, he gave the
result of the events, made a strange medley of sound.</p>

<p>From one corner of the floor to another there ran
diagonally a lime-marked lane. Since half past seven
white-trunked figures had rushed, half a dozen at a
time, down this lane at top speed, had flung themselves
panting, with outstretched arms, against the mattresses
at the end, and had turned and trotted back to the
dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>The supply had seemed inexhaustible. Heat after
heat had been run in the Forty Yards Novice, heat
after heat in the Forty Yards Invitation, heat after
heat in the Forty Yards Handicap, and now the hurdles
were in place, the pistol was cracking forth, and
white-clad forms were flying breathlessly over the bars
and breasting the red string at the finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>At each report of the pistol the center gallery leaped
to its feet, the hurdlers sprang into sight from below
and sped away like arrows across the yellow floor.
Hurdles crashed, the crowd shouted, the racers flung
their arms at the tape and collapsed against the padded
wall at the end of the lane, and the center gallery
sank into its seats again and rustled its programs.
And the announcer lifted his crimson trumpet:</p>

<p>“Forty-five Yards Hurdles&mdash;fourth heat won by
No. 390, No. 3 second; time, 6⅖ seconds.”</p>

<p>There were dozens of colleges, schools, and associations
represented there that night, and hundreds of
competitors. There was the blue Y of Yale, the crimson
H of Harvard, the red C of Cornell, the green D
of Dartmouth, the purple E of Erskine, the brown R
of Robinson, and many, many other insignia flaunted
on heaving breasts.</p>

<p>Thirty-odd officials, in immaculate evening clothes,
lent a note of sobriety to the colorful scene, while a
blue-coated policeman, whose duty it was to guard the
long table of mugs and tankards, stood out intensely
against the gleam and glitter of the prizes. On the
big stage, the sloping bank of watchers looked from the
floor like a bed of waving somber-hued flowers. From
a corner of the balcony came the strains of brazen
music.</p>

<p>The jumping standards were set and the competitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
ranged themselves along the edge of the track, their
sweaters and dressing-gowns of all colors thrown loosely
about their bare shoulders. The Clerk of Course could
be heard at the dressing-room door summoning the men
for the next event:</p>

<p>“All out for the two miles!”</p>

<p>The sloping corners of the track rang with the
footsteps of the candidates as they warmed up. There
were fifteen entries, and among them were men from
Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Erskine
College. Erskine’s representative was rather nervous
as, with his number flapping at his back, he was assigned
the place at the pole in the front line. Beside
him was a Cornell runner whose prowess was well
known, and Allan Ware marveled at his own temerity.
Surely, he had no chance against the Cornell man, nor,
for that matter, against several of the others. Well,
he would run as well as he knew how and take his
beating philosophically.</p>

<p>The fact was, that the intense excitement was unnerving
him. And that was why, when the starter
had cried “Set!” Allan dashed forward, taking half
the line with him. For this misdemeanor he and three
others were promptly relegated to the last row. Then
the command came again and the pistol cracked.</p>

<p>At the first turn Allan had to fight to keep from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
being hustled from the track. After the next corner
the runners had settled down to their work, a New
York man making easy pace. Allan was well in front.
The nervousness had left him now and he had no
thought for the cheering spectators, for the blaring
strains from the band, for anything, in short, save the
struggle on hand. Lap after lap was reeled off until
the race was half finished. Allan was still holding
his own, with the consciousness of much power in
reserve. The New York man still kept the lead, while
close on his heels ran one of the Cornell contingent.</p>

<p>Presently a Yale man fought his way up to Allan,
and for half a lap they contested fifth place. Then,
at a turn, the Yale man took the bank and slid into
the lead, and Allan was sixth. He expected changes
ahead. Of course the New York runner would not
attempt to keep the lead much longer. He would drop
back, Allan would overhaul the Yale chap, and in the
last two laps he would call on the reserve power he
was certain he had and fight it out to the finish.</p>

<p>He looked back. The nearest runner was several
yards away and didn’t appear dangerous. The relative
positions remained unchanged for another lap, and then
things began to happen.</p>

<p>The Yale man dropped back, a second Cornell man&mdash;Allan
recognized him as the one who had been beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
him at the start&mdash;spurted into third place, and Allan
found himself still running fifth. He had lost count
of the laps, but believed there could not be more than
two left.</p>

<p>So he started to crawl up. At the next corner,
that by the dressing-rooms, he passed the Cornell man
who had been second for so long; his duty was done
and he was easing up on his pace. Down the stretch
Allan gained on a Technology runner, but failed to
pass him. Suddenly the gong announcing the last lap
clanged. Allan glanced across the hall. The New
York man was still in the lead, and was increasing
that lead at every stride.</p>

<p>Allan threw back his head and fought for third
place. On the next stretch footsteps sounded behind
him. At the first corner Allan just succeeded in keeping
the lead; on the short stretch, a Yale man passed
him and left him as though standing. It was all up
now; he was fifth, and there was no chance of bettering
his position. The leader, well ahead of the Cornell
man, was taking the last corner. The Yale man who
had just passed Allan was taking third place hand over
fist. The Technology runner was plainly faltering,
and yet, thought Allan savagely, here was he, with all
sorts of power of lung and muscle left, dragging along
behind him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He clasped his hands tighter and threw himself
forward. Fourth place was better than fifth, he told
himself, and at least he would not be beaten by a man
who was ready to fall. So up he went, working as
hard to beat out the Technology runner as though first
place was at stake. And beat him he did, and turned
off of the track and walked back to the dressing-room
apparently as untired as when he had started.</p>

<p>“You lost that race,” said Kernahan, “when you
lost your place in the first row. But don’t you care;
you’ve learned a thing or two, and one of them’s to
wait for the pistol.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not decently winded,” Allan complained.
“I could run the mile now, and yet those chaps
beat me.”</p>

<p>“Sprinting ability is what you’ve got to learn, my
boy. And with three months before the dual&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang the dual!” said Allan, petulantly. “I
wanted to win this.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the mile yet,” said Billy, soothingly.</p>

<p>But the mile brought Allan scant satisfaction. He
was given a handicap of thirty-five yards, and, although
this time he was careful to wait for the pistol, he came to
the conclusion when half the distance was run that he
might as well drop out of the race. There were almost
fifty entries, and it seemed less a race than a fast-moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
procession. The turns were always filled with fellows
elbowing and fighting, and after the half-distance it
was hard to tell who the leaders were, so close they
were to the tail-enders.</p>

<p>Rindgely and Harris had also entered, and about
the only satisfaction Allan was able to gather was derived
from the fact that he had them beaten from the
start. But the smaller handicaps allowed those youths
had something to do with that. Allan never knew
what number he was at the finish, and didn’t much
care.</p>

<p>In the dressing-room, Harris, Rindgely, Long, and
Monroe&mdash;the latter the only Erskine entry who had
won a place&mdash;were finding balm in the fact that Robinson
hadn’t showed up in a single event.</p>

<p>“Wait until the team race, though,” said Rindgely,
darkly. “That’s where they’ll get us; you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it,” said Harris, stoutly. “When
does it come off?”</p>

<p>“After this, I think,” said Long. “Who’s got a
program?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Monroe. “Hello, Ware!
Say, that was a perfect mess, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” growled Allan. “I never knew
whether I was running this lap or the last one.”</p>

<p>“Or the one ahead,” added Harris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thought you were going to do something,” said
Rindgely. “You had a good chance.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” Allan responded, with intense sarcasm.
“All right, only I didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here and see the Harvard and
Penn race,” Long suggested. “Where’s our team?”</p>

<p>“They’re out there somewhere. Thatcher says
we’re going to get it put all over us,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“Thatcher’s an old raven,” said Harris, as they
crowded out to where they could watch the race. “If
he runs as well as he croaks, we’re all right.”</p>

<p>Harvard secured the race with University of Pennsylvania,
and though the result was not long in doubt,
yet the crimson-clad runners were forced to better the
record by three-fifths of a second. Then the clerk’s
voice was heard at the dressing-room door:</p>

<p>“All out for Erskine-Robinson Team Race! All
out!”</p>

<p>Of Erskine’s relay team, only Thatcher, the captain,
was an experienced runner. The others&mdash;Poor,
Gibbons, and Tolmann&mdash;had earned the right to represent
the college at the trials, but for all of that were
unknown quantities. They were all of them, Thatcher
included, small men; Poor was little over five feet in
height, and looked as though he had never had enough
to eat. As they trotted around the track, getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
warmed up, Robinson’s candidates overtopped them to
a man. It was a big, long-limbed quartet that Robinson
had sent, and had the result depended on height
and length of leg alone the Brown would have had the
race won at the start.</p>

<p>Allan had secured a place near the front of the
throng at the dressing-room door, and beside him,
noticeable because of the evening clothes which he wore,
was one of the officials, an inspector whose name was
down on the program as “Horace L. Pearson,
N. Y. A. C.” It was while the two teams were still
warming up that Allan heard his name spoken, and
turned to find Mr. Pearson in conversation with
Harris.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon,” the inspector was saying, “but
the man beyond you there is Ware, of your college,
isn’t he?” But he wasn’t looking in Allan’s direction
at all.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Harris, “that’s Rindgely.”</p>

<p>“Sure of it?”</p>

<p>“Quite, sir,” replied Harris, smiling.</p>

<p>“Hm! I saw he was down on the card as Rindgely,
but I thought maybe it was a mistake. What does the
other man, Ware, look like?”</p>

<p>“He’s here somewhere,” said Harris. And then
his voice dropped and Allan, looking carefully away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
felt the inspector’s gaze upon his face. He wondered
what it might mean and why Rindgely had been mistaken
for him, but his speculation was short-lived, for
at that moment the pistol cracked and two runners,
one with his white shirt crossed with a brown silk
ribbon and the other bearing a purple E on his breast,
sprang forward and fought for the lead at the first
turn. The Erskine man was Thatcher and his opponent
was named Guild. As they reached the other
end of the track and sped past the dressing-room, conflicting
shouts of encouragement from Erskine and
Robinson supporters followed them.</p>

<p>Thatcher had secured the pole at the start and had
leaped into the lead at the turn. He was still ahead,
but Guild was close behind him, his long strides seeming
to be always on the point of taking him past, yet
never doing so. Thatcher’s plan was plainly to hand
over the race to the next runner of his team with a
good, big margin of gain, trusting that, if unable to
increase the advantage, the other Erskine men would
at least hold what they had. But the big gain wasn’t
forthcoming yet.</p>

<p>As he neared the starting-point and the finish of
the first of his two laps he strove desperately to leave
his opponent, but it was not until the last lap was a
third run that daylight opened up between the two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
The Robinson chap was proving himself a worthy foe.
Half-way around the last lap there was ten feet between
Purple and Brown. From there on down to the
mark, where the next two men stood with eager, outstretched
hands, Thatcher gained and gained; but he
had commenced late, and when Guild touched the hand
of his team-mate and fell over into the arms of the
Robinson trainer he was only fifteen yards to the
bad.</p>

<p>Gibbons, short of leg and rather heavy of build,
was flying over the first turn as though possessed, and
behind him pattered Thorpe of Robinson. Down the
stretch they flew, while the band was drowned by the
shouts of the onlookers. It was a pretty contest that,
even though to discerning ones, at least, the end was
not in doubt. Gibbons looked like a small whirlwind,
and gave every indication of killing himself before the
second lap was finished, but Thorpe, with long and
easy strides, ate up the interval between them foot by
foot, and when the second lap began was in position
to take the lead whenever he wanted to.</p>

<p>Half-way down the side he did so. Gibbons fought
him off desperately for an instant, but at the turn
Robinson led by a yard. Then it was that Gibbons
surprised even his trainer, for, instead of steadily
dropping back, he refused to yield an inch and chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Thorpe down to the finish like an avenging fate, crossing
the line a bare yard behind him.</p>

<p>That yard of advantage was five yards half through
the next lap, Tolmann failing to prove a match for
Brine of Robinson. Foot after foot and yard after
yard opened up between them, and when the last lap
began the Brown’s runner was an eighth of a lap ahead.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s settled right now,” said Long, who
had jostled his way to Allan’s side. “If we still had
Thatcher we might stand some show, but I guess Poor
can’t cut down that lead enough to make it look even
close.”</p>

<p>“Thatcher’s idea was all right,” said Allan, “but
he didn’t know how good his man was. Robinson’s
next man is her captain, I think, and I suppose he
ought to be the best of the lot.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be, but maybe he isn’t. Poor is a
plucky little chap, and maybe he’ll give Jones a run
for his money. Look at him!”</p>

<p>At the other end of the hall Erskine’s last hope was
leaning over the mark, one slim white arm thrust forward
and one reaching impatiently back toward where
Tolmann, swaying and gasping, was vainly striving to
save the race. Poor looked plucky without a doubt,
and when, after what seemed an age, Tolmann struck
weakly at his hand and staggered off the track, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
off like a shot, his thin legs twinkling like a salmon-colored
streak as he followed the Robinson captain.
The latter was almost a quarter of a lap ahead and
was running easily, yet keeping a watchful glance upon
his opponent. And, as it proved, that watchful glance
was not thrown away.</p>

<p>The band blared forth a two-step with might and
main, supporters of the rival colleges clapped, shouted,
and shrieked, and the runners’ shoes <em>tap-tapped</em> on the
floor and pounded over the built-up corners.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, a roar started among the
audience and gathered volume and swept deafeningly
across the great hall, and Allan, raising himself on
tiptoes, gave a shout of joy. For just an instant or
two after passing the second turn the Robinson captain
had become inattentive to his pursuer, and in that brief
moment Poor had literally eaten up space with his
flying feet until now twenty yards would have spanned
the distance between them. Jones, warned by the applause,
leaped ahead, but Poor refused to yield an inch
he had gained. More than that, he kept on gaining.</p>

<p>The bell clanged the beginning of the last lap of
the race and the Robinson runner swept over the line
fifteen yards ahead of Poor, his long strides making
the latter’s look ridiculously short by comparison.
But if his strides were short, they were also rapid, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Poor, his little, weazened face screwed into an agony
of effort, chased his opponent down in the next half
lap, and at the second turn was barely two yards behind.
Jones was plainly worried. As he pounded around the
corner his right arm was thrust out in an involuntary
effort to keep his opponent from passing him. But
Poor was not able to do that on the turn, and for the
next stretch their relative positions remained unchanged.</p>

<p>As they dashed by the group at the dressing-room
door, Allan and Long and Harris and the others
shrieked exhortations and encouragement to their runner.
Then the next turn was taken, Jones stumbled,
saved himself, and led the way down the last stretch,
his head back, his mouth wide open, and his speed
lessening at every stride.</p>

<p>But if he was ready to give up, so, too, was Poor,
who had run a quarter of a lap farther than he. And all
the way down that stretch the Robinson captain struggled
and faltered and the Erskine runner dogged his
steps, unable to pass him. And then something happened,
and so quickly that it was all over before the
sight had time to register the meaning of it on the
brain.</p>

<p>Half-way over the turn, and twenty yards from
the finish, Jones swayed, tripped, and rolled over to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
edge of the track, and Poor, less than two yards behind
him, plunged blindly over him, sprawled and rolled
along for three yards, and then, in some strange manner,
found his feet and took up the running again.
So, too, did Jones, but the larger man had fallen more
heavily, and for an instant remained dazed upon the
floor.</p>

<p>That instant decided the race, for although he was
up again almost before the audience had sensed the
catastrophe, yet he had lost the lead. For the last few
yards the two men, giddy, swaying, their heads fallen
almost onto their breasts, strove weakly for the line.
The next moment Poor threw out his arms and sprawled
forward on his face across the chalk-mark and Jones,
stumbling past him, fell, sliding on hands and knees
to the edge of the track.</p>

<p>Down by the dressing-room door Allan and the
others were whooping it up joyfully, for Erskine had
turned defeat into victory and won the relay by a scant
three yards!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>ALLAN LEAVES THE CLUB TABLE</small></h2>


<p>March winds are freakish, prankish things, and
the wind in the face of which Allan crossed the yard
one morning a fortnight or so after the indoor meeting
was no exception. He was on his way from Grace
Hall to the Chemical Laboratory for a ten o’clock, and
at the corner of the chapel he passed a couple of fellows
whom a casual glance showed him he did not know.
But that he was not a stranger to one of them was
soon proven. The wind, scurrying around the corner
of the chapel, tossed him the following fragment of
conversation with startling distinctness:</p>

<p>“Who’s that fellow, Steve?”</p>

<p>“Ware, a freshie; he runs, or tries to. He was
in the mile and two miles at Boston week before last
and didn’t do a thing in either of them. Guess the
Athletic Association will take his job away now. They
just employed him to keep him in college, I guess.
This thing of giving fellows work just because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The words ended as suddenly as they had begun,
so far as Allan was concerned, and he strode on to the
laboratory. But his cheeks were burning and his heart
was filled with wrath. For the first time he realized
that his employment by the E. A. A. had a suspicious
look, to say the least, while it was even probable that
what the fellow he had overheard thought was really
true. He was angry at the unknown youth for saying
what he had, angry with Stearns for placing him in
such a questionable position, and angry at Professor
Nast for countenancing it. He wondered whether all
the fellows he knew or who knew him believed as did
the fellow he had passed, that he was knowingly allowing
the Athletic Association to present him with money
he was not earning.</p>

<p>The blood dyed his face again, and he marveled at
his blindness. Why had he not seen from the first that
Stearns had secured him the place in the office merely
to ensure his stay at college and his participation in
the dual meet with Robinson? And hadn’t he more
than half suspected all along? But no, he was guiltless
of that charge. Credulous and blind he had been, but
not dishonest. And dishonest he would not be now.
He passed a miserable, impatient half-hour, and when
it was over hurried to the office of the Athletic Association
and found Professor Nast at his desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor was a mild-mannered little man,
rather nervous and seemingly indecisive, but he was
executively capable and had much sound common sense.
He viewed Allan’s arrival with mild curiosity, nodded
silently, and turned back to his work. But Allan didn’t
allow him to continue it.</p>

<p>“How much am I worth here, sir, if you please?”
he demanded, unceremoniously. The chairman looked
somewhat startled and disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;that is a difficult question to answer,
Mr. Ware. But if you&mdash;ah&mdash;consider that you are not
being paid enough, I shall be glad to consider the matter
of increased remuneration if you will make out an
application in writing, stating&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, is my work here worth a dollar an hour,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Eh? A dollar an hour? I&mdash;er&mdash; But I think
you are receiving that amount, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and that’s what the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“Trouble? Suppose you explain what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, I&mdash;” He hesitated for words an instant
and then threw politeness to the winds. “You’ve made
me do what isn’t honest, you and Stearns,” he charged,
angrily. “You offered me the work here just to keep
me in college, so I could run at your old meet, and
you gave me a dollar an hour for work that any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
would do for half that money. Oh, I know it’s lots
my fault,” he went on, silencing the professor’s remonstrances.
“I ought to have guessed it, but I didn’t.
I didn’t think a thing about it until to-day I overheard
a fellow say in plain words that I was taking money
I wasn’t earning. That’s a nice thing to have fellows
say about you, isn’t it? And I dare say the whole
college thinks just as he does, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold up a minute,” said the professor, finally
making himself heard. “You’re accusing Mr. Stearns
and me of pretty hard things. Let’s talk this over
quietly. Sit down, please.”</p>

<p>Allan obeyed. The professor swung around in his
chair until he faced him, clasped his hands over his
vest, and gravely studied Allan’s angry countenance.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that you&mdash;ah&mdash;have any right to
come here and charge me&mdash;or Mr. Stearns&mdash;with unfair
dealings. But I will accord you the right, Mr.
Ware, for I see that there has been a mistake made.
It was, however, a mistake and nothing more, I assure
you. Neither Mr. Stearns nor I had any intention
of deceiving you. Allow me to finish, please,” he
added, as Allan made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>“It has been the custom here, of recent years, to
give employment in this office to men who have needed
the work, and preference has been given to athletes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
If they have been paid more for their labor than that
labor was really worth&mdash;and I am ready to grant that
they usually have&mdash;the money with which they were
paid has always come out of the general athletic fund
and not from the college. I am not&mdash;ah&mdash;prepared
to defend this custom; on the contrary, sir, I think
it a very bad one, and I for one should be glad to see
it discontinued. In your case, now, Mr. Stearns came
and saw me and told me you needed employment. The
place was vacant and I offered it to you at the terms
which have always been paid. You are not earning
one dollar an hour, Mr. Ware, and if you feel that you
have been deceived by us, I am very sorry. No deception
was intended on my part, and I am sure Mr.
Stearns believed that you&mdash;er&mdash;understood the situation.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, though,” answered Allan, somewhat conciliated
by the other’s manner. “I didn’t dream of it.
I&mdash;I did think the work was rather easy considering
the pay, but I thought maybe it would get harder, and
that&mdash;that I could make up. If I had known the
truth, I wouldn’t have had anything to do with the
work.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but, as I have said, there was no
intent at deception. I offer you my apologies, and I
am sure Mr. Stearns will be quite as regretful as I am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
If there is anything I can do to better matters, I shall
be delighted to do it, Mr. Ware.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there is. I’d like to keep on with the
work until I have squared myself.”</p>

<p>“You mean you want to work without wages?”</p>

<p>Allan nodded. The professor considered the matter
for a while in silence. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you insist,” he said, “we will make that arrangement.
But there is another method that may
answer fully as well. Are you averse to continuing
the work at&mdash;er&mdash;a just remuneration?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I suppose not,” Allan replied. “I need the
work, and if you’ll pay me only what it’s worth I’d
like to go ahead with it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you say so, for you have been
very conscientious, Mr. Ware, and your services in
the office have become valuable to me. I should dislike
to make a change. Supposing, then, you continue
at&mdash;ah&mdash;fifty cents an hour? Would that be
satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Is it worth that much?” asked Allan, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it honestly is; it is worth quite that. Well,
and in regard to&mdash;ah&mdash;let us say arrears; I am working
on the compilation of a rather difficult lot of statistics
which are to be incorporated into my report. You
could assist me vastly with that matter and could work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
say, an hour three evenings a week. In that way,
it seems to me, you could very shortly ‘square’ yourself,
as you term it, and could, to some extent, choose
your own time for doing so. What do you&mdash;ah&mdash;think?”</p>

<p>Allan considered the matter. It sounded rather
easy, and since an hour ago he had grown to view
easy tasks with suspicion. But he could find no ground
for objection, and in the end he accepted the proposal
gratefully and stammered a somewhat lame apology for
his hasty discourtesy. The Chairman of the Athletic
Committee waved it politely aside.</p>

<p>“We will consider it settled, then,” he said. “This
afternoon we will decide on the hours for the extra
work. I’m glad you brought this matter up, Mr. Ware,
for I think the time has come to do away with a
pernicious custom. Good morning.”</p>

<p>On his way to his next recitation Allan reflected
somewhat ruefully that under the new arrangement
there was one thing which had been lost sight of, and
that was a public vindication. As long as he continued
to work in the office fellows would continue to think
he was receiving money not earned. To be sure, he had
the consolation of a clear conscience, but it was hard
to have the fellows he knew and whose respect he craved
think badly of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>But there Allan was mistaken, for the story got
out in short order&mdash;Tommy saw to that!&mdash;and it wasn’t
long before he heard an account of the matter, in which
he figured as a model of indignant virtue and a galley-slave
to conscience, from a fellow whom he knew very
slightly. After that he had no doubts about public
vindication.</p>

<p>It was not a difficult matter to find three hours in
the evening each week for the new labor, and he found
it, since he had a fondness for mathematics, far more
interesting than the daily letter-writing and clerical
work. But five dollars a week wasn’t ten, and so,
despite the protests of Pete and all the other members
of the club table, he left the hospitality of Mrs.
Pearson’s and went back to the college dining-hall,
where he could, by careful management, make his
monthly bill ridiculously small. Pete commanded and
implored to be allowed to “fix things up” so that Allan
need not leave the table; he almost wept; but Allan
was obdurate. Pete even threatened to “let the table
go hang” and return with Allan to Commons, but was
finally dissuaded when Allan pointed out that in all
probability he (Allan) would very shortly be taken
onto the training-table of the track squad.</p>

<p>So Pete accepted the inevitable and draped Allan’s
chair with some dozen yards of black crêpe, and allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
none to occupy it for a week of mourning. But Allan
wasn’t a stranger to the table, for every Saturday night
he returned there as Pete’s guest and sat in his old
seat and was made much of by the crowd.</p>

<p>Thus warbled Tommy as, having kicked the door
shut, he subsided into one of Allan’s chairs by sliding
over the back. Allan pushed his book away, yawned
dismally, and looked over at his visitor mutely questioning:</p>

<p>“Where’s Pete?” Tommy demanded.</p>

<p>“Am I his keeper?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“You’re his <i>fidus whatyoucallit</i>. Seen him to-night?”</p>

<p>“No; maybe he’s studying.”</p>

<p>“Careless youth,” muttered Tommy. “Say, did

<p>“No; who’s Bœotia, anyway?”</p>

<p>“What did old Grove say?” laughed Allan.</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t there and can’t tell you. I’m
going to settle my debts this week, and we’ll have that
dinner at the Elm Tree Saturday night, if that’s all
right for you fellows.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right for me,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“The funny part of it is,” Tommy went on, smiling,
“that I made just enough to pay for the dinner
out of the reports of Pete’s drowning which I sent to
the Boston paper. I got my account yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to Pete,” laughed Allan.</p>

<p>“I’m going to. Where’s the angel child?”</p>

<p>“The angel child is probably out in the kitchen.
I can’t keep her at home since vacation; she found out
then where the grub comes from.”</p>

<p>“I think she ought to go to the dinner with us,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, scarcely. Let’s go down to the ‘Ranch’
and see what Pete’s up to. I can’t study any more
to-night.”</p>

<p>Town Lane was as dark as pitch save at remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
intervals where street lamps flickered half-heartedly,
and to reach Pete’s domicile at night without breaking
a limb was quite a feat. To-night nothing more exciting
occurred than a collision with a stable door which
was swinging open, and the two reached the corner to
find Pete’s windows brightly illumined. Tommy, being
in a musical mood, took up a position underneath and
broke into song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here ’neath thy window, Love, I am waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Waiting thy sweet face to see,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">he declared, strumming the while on an imaginary
guitar. But the verse came to an end without signs
from the window, and so they climbed the stairs. The
“Ranch” was deserted. But even as they assured
themselves of the fact by looking into the bedroom,
soft footfalls sounded on the stairs from the third-story
loft, and a moment after Pete, looking like a conspirator,
crept into the front room and softly closed the door
behind him. Then his eyes fell on Allan and Tommy,
and he grinned mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” Allan demanded.</p>

<p>“Up-stairs.”</p>

<p>“What’s doing up there?” asked Tommy, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all.” But the grin remained. Tommy
sniffed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going up to see,” he threatened.</p>

<p>Pete sank into a chair, took up his pipe, and spread
his hands apart as if to say, “Please yourself; believe
me or not, as you like.” Then he lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>“What have you done with your coat?” asked
Allan. “And why are you festooned with cobwebs and
decorated with dust?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quien sabe?</i>” answered Pete, shrugging his broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Just the same, you’ve been up to something,”
declared Allan, sternly. “And you’d better ’fess up.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Pete.</p>

<p>“Out with it!” commanded Tommy.</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Pete again.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a blamed old Indian, doesn’t he?”
asked Tommy, disgustedly. “Well, don’t you come
and beg me to intercede with the Dean for you.”</p>

<p>The smile on Pete’s face broadened; he chuckled
enjoyably; but commands and demands failed to move
him to confession, and, after arranging for the dinner
at the Inn, Allan and Tommy took their departure,
Pete, for some reason and contrary to custom, making no
effort to detain them. As they clambered down the
steep stairs, Pete called after them:</p>

<p>“Say, it would be a great night for a fire,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fire?” repeated Allan. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, such a dandy old high wind,” answered Pete.
“Well, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adios</i>.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what he meant?” said Allan, on the way
back. “It would be just like him to get into another
mess.”</p>

<p>“About time,” chuckled Tommy. “Good night.”</p>

<p>Allan went to bed soon after eleven, with Two Spot,
according to nightly custom, curled up against the
small of his back. For a while he lay awake listening
to the howling and buffeting of the wind, but presently
sleep came to him.</p>

<p>It seemed hours later, but was in reality scarcely
thirty minutes, when he awoke abruptly with the wild
clanging of a bell in his ears. He sat up and listened.
It was undoubtedly the fire-bell, and had he had any
doubt about it the sound of running footsteps in the
street would have convinced him at once.</p>

<p>For a moment he weighed the prospective excitement
of a conflagration against the comforts of the
warm bed. In the end the fire offered greater inducements,
and he leaped out of bed, lighted the gas, and
tumbled into his clothes. And all the time the fire-bell
clanged and clashed on the March wind. Leaving Two
Spot to the undisputed possession of the bed, Allan left
the house and looked expectantly about him. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was no glow in the sky in any quarter; darkness reigned
everywhere save about the infrequent street lamps.
Here and there persons were running toward the fire-house,
and Allan followed their example.</p>

<p>Down Main Street he hurried, entered the yard
back of the library, and cut across in the face of the
buffeting wind to the beginning of Town Lane. When
he reached Elm Street he was part of a steady stream
of excited citizens and students, all hurrying anxiously
toward where, half-way down the narrow thoroughfare,
the brazen alarum was pealing deafeningly forth. And
then, for the first time since he had awoke, Allan recollected
Pete and his mysterious observation regarding
fire. And instantly he knew that Pete and the fire-bell
were in some way working mischief together.</p>

<p>Pete’s rooms were in the building at the corner of
Center Street, and next door stood the fire-house, a
plain two-storied building, surmounted by a twenty-foot
tower, at the top of which hung the bell. When Allan
reached the scene the windows of Pete’s front room
were brilliantly illumined, and from one of them hung
Pete, exchanging lively salutations with friends in the
throng below.</p>

<p>For a moment Allan’s suspicions were deadened.
In front of the fire-house the crowd jostled and craned
their necks as they stared wonderingly upward to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the tower showed indistinctly against the midnight sky.
On every hand were heard bewildered ejaculations,
while members of the volunteer fire department ran
hither and thither, questioning, suggesting, and plainly
distracted. The big doors were open and inside the
engine and hose-cart, horses in harness, were ready to
sally forth the instant any one discovered where the fire
was or why the bell clanged on and on without apparent
reason. Through a hole in the ceiling a big rope
descended, and at every clang of the bell it rose and
fell again, and the building shook with the jar.</p>

<p>“Hello, Allan! Isn’t this great?” shouted a voice
in his ear, and Allan turned to find Hal, arrayed principally
in a plaid dressing-gown and white duck cricket
hat, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but what is it?” asked Allan, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Don’t know; nobody knows. There’s the bell and
there’s the rope; no one’s pulling it; must be spooks!
Isn’t it jolly?” And Hal leaped with delight and
thumped Allan on the back.</p>

<p>“But why does the bell ring?” he asked, following
the general example and staring upward at the
tower.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Why does it? Some say it’s the wind,
but that’s poppycock, you know. What I think is that
some one’s got a rope hitched to the bell and is pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it from the back of the building somewhere; that’s what
I think.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t they been around there to see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they’re so excited and fussed they
wouldn’t know a rope if they fell over it. Some one’s
having a lark, you can bet on that. Isn’t it a picnic?
Just hear the old bell! Wow! Listen to that!”</p>

<p>Allan put his mouth to Hal’s ear and whispered
a single word. Hal started, shot a glance at Pete’s
window and Pete himself, and burst into a gale of
laughter.</p>

<p>“D-d-do you think so?” he gasped. “But&mdash;how
could he? Look, there he is at the window. O Pete!”</p>

<p>“Hush up!” whispered Allan. “They’ll get onto
it. Look, they’ve got a ladder! They’ll find out what’s
up now, all right, because the rope will be hanging.
We ought to warn Pete; come on!”</p>

<p>They wormed their way through the crowd, exchanging
shouts of salutation with acquaintances as
they went, until they were under Pete’s window.
There they found Tommy, note-book in hand, looking
very important and excited.</p>

<p>“O Pete!” shouted Allan. “Is your door unlocked?”</p>

<p>“Hello, partner!” returned Pete in a happy
bellow. “Isn’t this great? Here I sit at my parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
window and watch all the wealth, beauty and fashion
of our charming metropolis. And, say, ain’t the racket
fine? This is more noise than I’ve heard since a dynamite
blast went off behind my back! Why, it’s almost
like living in a city! Say, if you fellows&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We want to come up,” shouted Allan. “Unlock
your door.”</p>

<p>Pete shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not on your life, partner; I’ve only got my nightie
on. Want me to freeze to death?”</p>

<p>“Well, put something on,” said Allan anxiously,
“and come down.”</p>

<p>“’Fraid of catching cold. Besides, I must turn in
now; I’m losing my beauty sleep.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but, Pete, they’re&mdash;they’re putting up a
ladder!” blurted Allan.</p>

<p>“Are they?” asked Pete imperturbably. “Well,
I’m not coming down to help ’em. They’ll have to get
on without me, my boy. Hello, Hal, that you? Ain’t
this wano? Such a cheerful&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pete’s roar stopped suddenly, as did the noise of the
crowd. Two firemen half-way up the ladder at the
front of the building nearly fell off. For a sudden appalling
silence gave place to the uproar! The bell was
still!</p>

<p>After a moment of startled surprise&mdash;for at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the silence seemed louder than the noise&mdash;every one
broke into incoherent laughter and ejaculations. The
men on the ladder paused, undecided, and finally slid
back to earth to hold a consultation.</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t that a shame!” lamented Pete. “Just
when I was beginning to get sleepy! Now I’m all woke
up again. Say, you chaps, wait a bit and I’ll slip something
on and let you up.” He disappeared from the
window and was gone some time. Then the key scraped
in the door at the foot of the stairs and Allan, Hal, and
Tommy slipped through. Pete, standing guard, locked
the portal in the faces of several undesired fellows and
followed them up-stairs.</p>

<p>As Allan entered the room he glanced eagerly around.
Just what he expected to find would have been hard to
say, but whatever it was he didn’t find it. The room
presented its usual appearance, save that articles of
apparel lay scattered widely about just wherever Pete
had happened to be when they came off. Pete locked
the room door, took his pipe from the table and proceeded
to fill it. The others looked about the room, looked at
each other and looked at Pete. Pete scratched a match,
lighted his corn-cob and smiled easily back. Allan sank
into the easy chair.</p>

<p>“How&mdash;how did you do it?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Do it? Do what?” asked Pete, blowing a cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of smoke toward the open window. Outside sounds told
of the dispersing of the throng.</p>

<p>“You know what,” said Allan.</p>

<p>Pete went to the window, called good night to an
acquaintance, closed the sash and ambled back, smiling
enjoyably.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it moocha wano?” he asked. “Just answer
me that, Allan. Did anything ever go off more
beautifully, with more&mdash;er&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>, as we say in Paree?
Is your Uncle Pete the boss, all-star bell-ringer? Did
you get on to the expression, the&mdash;the phrasing? Did
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Pete,” said Hal, grinning. “Tell us
about it. Go on, like a good chap.”</p>

<p>“There’s little to tell,” said Pete with becoming
modesty. “Up there”&mdash;he pointed toward the ceiling&mdash;“is
a loft. Over there is a bell. Bring a rope from
the bell into the back window of the loft, down-stairs
and through that door and&mdash;there you are! Quite
simple.”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” piped up Tommy. “You were
at the window when the bell was doing its stunts. How&mdash;how
was that?”</p>

<p>“Simple, too,” answered Pete, waving aside a cloud
of smoke. “There was a noose in the end of the rope
and the noose fitted over my knee as I kneeled on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
floor. It was hard work and I guess the hide’s about
wore off, but it was all for the sake of Art.”</p>

<p>The three deluged him with questions simultaneously,
and Pete, sitting nonchalantly on the edge of
the table, answered them as best he could.</p>

<p>“But how about the rope?” asked Allan finally.
“They’ll see it and trace it through the window.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they won’t, because, my boy, it isn’t there
any longer. When I said I’d put something on and let
you fellows in, I cut it off at the foot of the tower and
brought my end of it away. They’ll find a rope there,
all right, but they’ll never guess it went through the back
window. Besides, I can prove an alibi,” he ended, with
a generous and virtuous smile.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Tommy. “We saw you at
the window.”</p>

<p>“When the bell was ringing,” added Hal.</p>

<p>“And I saw both his hands,” supplemented Allan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I meant you should,” said Pete. Going to
the trunk he took from behind it the lariat which usually
hung on the wall, and from one end of it detached a few
feet of hemp rope. This he put into the stove. The
lariat he replaced upon the wall.</p>

<p>“Thus we destroy all evidences of guilt,” he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>PETE PUTS THE SHOT</small></h2>


<p>For a few days following the mysterious serenade on
the fire-bell there was an epidemic of mild colds throughout
the college; and as each fellow who had a cold was
able and eager to tell&mdash;through his nose&mdash;what had happened
at the fire-house, it would seem that there might
have been some connection between the affliction and the
midnight occurrence. But no serious illness resulted,
and so we may leniently assert that no harm came of
Pete’s joke.</p>

<p>Not that any one knew it was Pete’s joke, save the
quartet and one other. The one other was Mr. Guild,
out at Hillcrest. When morning came the severed rope
hung in plain sight from the bell tower, and although
it told clearly what had happened, yet it threw no light
on the identity of the culprit. Of course every one&mdash;townfolk
especially&mdash;declared it to have been a student
prank, but none suspected Pete Burley, for it apparently
entered no one’s head that the bell might have been
rung from Pete’s room. The perpetrator was popularly
believed to have been hidden in some near-by yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>That Pete’s innocence was never questioned was a
lucky thing for Pete, because the faculty would have
viewed the affair in the light of a last straw, and Pete’s
connection with Erskine College would have ceased then
and there. As it was, the affair remained forever a
mystery.</p>

<p>Mr. Guild heard the story a few days later, when
the quartet drove out to Hillcrest in a rattle-trap carryall
and spent the afternoon. This was the second visit
the fellows had made to the owner of the ducks since
the beginning of the term. Mr. and Mrs. Guild had
been in the South for two months, and after their return,
in February, the snow had made the roads almost impassable.
Hal and Tommy had been introduced on the
occasion of the previous visit and had been cordially
welcomed. Mr. Guild enjoyed the story of the bell-ringing
and laughed heartily over it.</p>

<p>“That’s a better joke, Burley,” he said, “than that
drowning business of yours. That was a trifle too grim
to be wholly humorous. And when I remember the way
I had the river dragged for your lifeless body, and expected
to see it every time the men drew the grapples up,
I&mdash;well, I hope your dinner the other night choked you.”</p>

<p>But it hadn’t. The dinner had passed off very successfully,
and save that Hal had partaken of too much
pie and had sat up in bed until three o’clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
morning well doubled over, it had been an affair worthy
of being long remembered. Even Pete, who claimed the
right to be severely critical, had found nothing to find
fault with, save, perhaps, the fact that in winning the
banquet he had unwittingly provided the money to pay
for it!</p>

<p>The second week in March witnessed the return of
the track team candidates to practise in the gymnasium.
Spring was unusually late that year&mdash;perhaps you recollect
the fact?&mdash;and several feet of snow hid the ground
until well toward the last of March. But meanwhile
the candidates, thirty-eight in number, were divided
into two squads and were daily put through chest-weight
and dumb-bell exercises and sent careening around the
running track. Allan, who since his failure to “make
good”&mdash;in the language of the undergraduate&mdash;had
been somewhat disgusted and down in the mouth, with
the return to practise experienced a renewal of faith in
himself and his abilities. Billy Kernahan laughed at
his pessimistic utterances and assured him that outdoor
work would do wonders for him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hal was hard at work with the freshman
baseball squad and was turning out to be something of
a “star” at the bat. Tommy, who during the winter
months had found much difficulty in keeping himself
busy, was as happy as a lark, since the awakening activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in athletics, the class debates and the final debate
with Robinson afforded him opportunities to perform
wonderful feats of reporting and gave him almost as
much work to do as even he could desire.</p>

<p>Pete was left forlorn. Of the quartet he alone had
no interest in life save study; and without wishing to
be hard on Pete, I am nevertheless constrained to say
that in his case study as an interest was something of a
failure. He managed to stand fairly well in class, but
this was due rather to an excellent memory than to any
feats of severe application. When, toward the last of
March, the baseball men and the track team went outdoors,
he was more deserted than ever. Hal and Allan
were inaccessible to him save in the evenings, and even
then insisted on studying. As for Tommy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“You might as well try to put your thumb on a flea
as to try and locate Tommy,” he growled aggrievedly.
“I tried to meet up with him on Monday, and the best
I could do was to find out where he had been last seen
on Saturday. I haven’t caught up with him yet, by
ginger!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go in for something?” asked Hal.
“Try baseball.”</p>

<p>“Baseball!” grunted Pete. “What do I know
about baseball? It would take me a month to learn the
rudiments of the game. I’ll go out for spring football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
practise next month, but that only lasts a couple of
weeks, they say, and after that I guess I’ll pack up and
go home.”</p>

<p>“Try golf,” said Allan, with a wicked smile. Pete
snorted.</p>

<p>“I’d look well hitting a little ball with a crooked
stick, wouldn’t I?” he asked disgustedly. “No; I
may be a blamed fool, but I know better than to make
such a show of myself as that.”</p>

<p>In the end Pete found an interest, and the manner
of it was strange. It happened in this wise.</p>

<p>It was a few days before the class games. If his
friends would not come to him, Pete could, at least, go
to his friends. And so he had got into the way of
walking out to the field in the afternoon and watching
Hal on the diamond or Allan on the track. Sometimes
he had a word or two with them; but at all events it
was better, he thought, than moping about the college.
The scene was a lively and, when the weather was bright,
a pretty one. To-day the sky was almost cloudless, the
sun shone warmly and there was a quality to the air
that made one want to do great things, but yet left one
content to do nothing.</p>

<p>When Pete approached the field he saw that the
varsity and freshman baseball teams were both at practise,
that the lacrosse candidates&mdash;whose antics always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
amused him&mdash;were racing madly about at the far corner
of the enclosure, and that the track men were on hand in
force. The scene was full of life and color and sound.
Pete broke into song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the age of seventeen young Sam began to roam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hit the trail for Texas a cowboy for to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a kinder-hearted feller you’d never hope to see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pete’s voice was untrained but hearty. Had the
tune been more melodious the effect would possibly have
been more pleasing. As it was, the adventures of Sam
Bass were chanted&mdash;as they always have been where
Pete came from&mdash;in a melancholy reiteration of some
half-dozen notes that threatened in the course of time
to become terribly monotonous.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sam used to own a thoroughbred known as the Denton mare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He matched her in scrub races and took her to the fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He always coined the money and spent&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song died away to a low rumble as Pete stooped
and picked up a battered sphere of lead which lay on the
sod before him. It was surprisingly heavy and he wondered
what it was. Then his gaze fell on a lime-marked
circle a few yards away, and it dawned upon him that
the thing he held was a sixteen-pound shot, such as he
had seen the fellows throw. Near-by the sod was dented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and torn where the weight had struck. Pete hefted the
thing in one hand and then the other. Then he raised
it head-high and threw it toward the circle. It narrowly
missed smashing the stop-board. Pete took up his song
once more:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He started for the Collins ranch, it was the month of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a herd of Texas cattle, the Black Hills for to see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He picked up the shot again and looked about him.
There was nobody near, and of those at a distance none
was paying him any attention. So he laid his pipe on
the ground, balanced the shot in his right hand, stepped
to the front of the circle and sent it through the air. It
described a good deal of an arc and came down about
eight paces away. Pete was sure he could beat that,
so he strolled over and recovered the weight, and, humming
lugubriously the while, strolled back and tried it
over again. This time it went a few feet farther and
Pete was encouraged. He took off his coat and rolled
his sleeves up, spat on his hands and seized that lump of
lead with determination.</p>

<p>Up near the finish of the mile, by the side of the
track, Allan was in conversation with Kernahan. Suddenly
he stopped, smiled, and pointed down the field.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake,” he exclaimed, “look at Pete
Burley trying to put the shot!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy turned and watched. When the shot had
landed, he asked:</p>

<p>“Has he ever tried that before?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; Pete’s stunt is football.” Kernahan
smiled.</p>

<p>“Sure. I remember him now. Well, you try a few
sprints of thirty yards or so, and I guess that’ll do for
to-day. That stride’s coming along all right; don’t be
in too big a hurry. To-morrow do a slow mile and a
few starts. Then you’d better knock off until the
meeting.”</p>

<p>Allan nodded, turned and jogged away up the track.
Billy strolled toward Pete. When he drew near his
ears were greeted with a plaintive wail:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Away sped the shot, and fell with a thud fully thirty
feet distant. Pete grunted. Billy’s face lighted. Pete
wiped the perspiration from his brow with the back of
one big hand and strolled after the shot. When he
turned back he saw the trainer. He looked somewhat
abashed and showed a disposition to drop the weight
where he stood. But he thought better of it.</p>

<p>“Taking a little exercise,” he explained, carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy nodded.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” he said. “Don’t throw it, but push
it right away from you as though you were punching
some one. You get it too high.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just fooling with it,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“I know; but you try it, and don’t let it go so high.”</p>

<p>The first attempt was a dismal failure, the shot
scarcely covering twenty feet. Billy’s presence embarrassed
the performer.</p>

<p>“Try it again,” said Billy. Pete hesitated. Then,</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>This time he did better than ever, and Billy paced
off the distance.</p>

<p>“About thirty-two feet,” he announced. “That’ll
do for to-day.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” said Pete.</p>

<p>“That’s enough for this time. You don’t want to
lame your muscles, if you haven’t done it already.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my muscles will stand it,” answered Pete.
“Do ’em good to get lame, I guess.” But Billy shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No, that won’t do. You leave off now and report
to me to-morrow at four-thirty.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Pete, in surprise.</p>

<p>“For practise. We’ll try you in the meet next
Friday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” said Pete, shaking his head. “If
you had a roping contest I might try my hand, but
these athletic stunts have me beat.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” answered the trainer,
“you do as I say. We need you, and we’re going to
have you. Four-thirty, remember; and you’d better get
some togs.”</p>

<p>He nodded and walked away. Pete, staring after
him, expressed his surprise by a long whistle.</p>

<small>TRACK AND FIELD</small></h2>


<p>The class games were notable that spring merely
because they brought into sudden prominence a new
and promising candidate in the shot-putting event, one
Peter Burley, ’07, of Blackwater, Colo. To be sure,
Pete didn’t break any records, nor did he come out first,
but he contributed one point to the scant sum of the
freshman class total by taking third place with a put of
thirty-nine feet, four and one-half inches. Pete’s appearance
in athletic circles was a surprise to the college
at large, and those who remembered his prowess at football
and took his size and apparent strength into consideration
jumped to the conclusion that here was a
“dark horse” that was going to carry everything before
him and break the college record into minute particles.
Personally, Pete viewed his participation as a good joke,
but he wasn’t quite certain whom the joke was on.</p>

<p>It was evident that he had it in him to become a
first-rate man at the weights, and Kernahan viewed his
“find” with much satisfaction. Erskine had for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
years past been rather weak in that line of athletics, and
Billy had visions of developing the big Westerner into
a phenomenal shot-putter and hammer-thrower; though,
for the present, at least, he said nothing to Pete about
the hammer, for fear the latter would mutiny. Pete
had had only three days of practise under Billy’s instruction
prior to the class games, but in that time he
had mastered one or two of the principal points and had
thereby added seven feet to his best performance of
Monday.</p>

<p>Billy was more than satisfied, the rival shot men,
who had viewed Pete’s appearance among them at
first with amused indifference, were worried, and Pete
was&mdash; But truly it is hard to say what Pete was. The
whole thing was something of a joke to him, and possibly
mild amusement was his principal sensation, although
he was probably glad to be able to please the trainer, who
had taken a good deal of trouble with him, and to add
a point to the tally of his class.</p>

<p>But after the class games amusement gave place to
surprise and dismay, for Billy informed him that the
spring meeting would take place a week later, and that
by diligent practise meanwhile he ought to be able to
add another two feet to his record. Pete had been
laboring under the impression that his troubles were
over with the class games, and he promptly rebelled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
But rebellion didn’t work with Billy; he was used to it.
He had a method of getting his own way in things that
was a marvel of quiet effectiveness; and so Pete concluded
when, on the next Monday, he was once more out
on the field “tossing the cannon ball,” as he sarcastically
called it.</p>

<p>All that week, up to the very morning of the spring
track meeting, he stood daily in the seven-foot circle and
practised with the shot, while Kernahan patiently
coached him. Pete had the height, build and strength
for the work, but it was the hardest kind of a task for
him to grasp the subtleties of the hop and the change of
feet. I am inclined to think that Billy’s oft-repeated
explanations went for little, and that in the end&mdash;but
this was not until he had been at practise for almost a
month&mdash;he learned the tricks himself by constant experimenting.</p>

<p>The actual putting was very soon mastered, but for
weeks Pete’s best efforts were spoiled because he either
overstepped the ring or left himself too far from the
front of it. But when the spring meeting came he
climbed to second place, Monroe alone keeping ahead of
him. The latter’s best put was forty-three feet ten
inches, and Pete’s forty-one feet three inches.</p>

<p>Monroe seemed to Pete to view the latter’s efforts as
beneath notice, and Pete resented that from the first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
As was to be expected by any one knowing Pete, Monroe’s
attitude was accepted as a challenge, and Pete
vowed he would beat the college crack if he had to work
all night to do it. From that time on Billy found no
necessity for pleading; Pete was always on hand when
half past four came around, and none was more earnest
than he, none worked so hard. Pete had found his
interest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Allan had done fairly well in both meets.
In the class games he had entered for the two miles and
the mile, had won the first by a bare yard from Rindgely
and in the latter had finished third behind Hooker and
Harris. At Billy’s advice he relinquished the mile event
thereafter and became a two-miler pure and simple.
As Billy pointed out, either Rindgely or Hooker&mdash;and
possibly Harris, who was coming on fast&mdash;was capable
of beating Robinson at the mile, and it was better for
Allan to put all efforts into the two miles, in which, so
far as was known, Robinson at present excelled. Allan
had hard luck at the spring meeting, getting away badly
in the first place and taking a tumble in the next to the
last lap that put him out of the race so far as the places
were concerned. Conroy staggered in ten yards ahead
of Rindgely, Harris securing third place, and Allan
finishing a poor fourth.</p>

<p>By this time the training table was started, and Pete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
much to his delight, temporarily deserted the freshman
club table up-stairs and moved to the first-floor front
room, where Allan, Rindgely, Hooker, Harris, Conroy,
Stearns, Thatcher, Poor, Leroy, Monroe, Long, and several
others whose names we have not heard, were congregated
under the vigilant eyes of Billy Kernahan. I
don’t think Pete was properly impressed with the honor
conferred upon him by his admission to the training
table, but he was glad to be with Allan again and rather
enjoyed the novelty of having his meals arranged for
him. If it had not been that training required the relinquishment
of his beloved corn-cob pipe, I think Pete
in those days would have been perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at another training table farther around
the bend of Elm Street, Hal was one of the stars of the
freshman nine. Of the quartet, Tommy only was not
head over ears in athletics, but the fact didn’t trouble
him a scrap. He had all he could do&mdash;and a trifle more&mdash;and
was laboring, besides, under the harmless delusion
that the college’s success on diamond, track, and
river depended largely upon his supervision and advice.
Whenever he had time, which wasn’t very often, he delighted
to stand beside the lime-marked ring and offer
gems of instruction in the art of putting the shot to
Pete. And Pete, who was miserable without companionship,
stood it smilingly for the sake of Tommy’s presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
In the evenings Tommy frequently found a moment
or two in which to look up Allan or Hal and give
them the benefit of his advice regarding playing second
base or running the two miles. But those young gentlemen
exhibited a strange and lamentable impatience, and
Tommy quite often left their presence under compulsion
or just ahead of a flying boot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the spring vacation came and went. Of
the quartet, Hal and Tommy went home, and Allan and
Pete stayed at college, Allan from motives of economy
and Pete because nothing better offered.</p>

<p>After recess baseball held the boards and the varsity
team was half-way through its schedule by the first week
in May, and had but two defeats behind it. On the track
the candidates were put through their paces six days a
week. Erskine was almost sure of victories in the
sprints, equally certain of defeats in the middle distances,
expected to win the mile, was in grave doubt as to
the two miles, and hoped to share the hurdles with her
opponent. In the field events, the high jump alone was
certain to yield a first to the Purple. The pole vault,
broad jump, and both weight events were of doubtful
outcome. As Tommy figured it out in the columns of
“his” paper about this time, Erskine had a chance of
winning by seven points. But as second and third
places were almost impossible to apportion with any accuracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
this forecast was not of much value. The dual
games with Robinson came on May 28th. A fortnight
before that Allan’s work was stretched over six days, as
follows:</p>

<p>Monday, a two-mile run at an easy pace.</p>

<p>Tuesday, a fast mile, followed by an easy three-quarters.</p>

<p>Wednesday, a hard, fast mile.</p>

<p>Thursday, two miles and a half in easy time.</p>

<p>Friday, a mile and a half at medium speed.</p>

<p>Saturday, a time trial over the two miles.</p>

<p>This was hard work and lots of it, but Allan’s physical
condition could scarcely have been bettered, and
never, from the beginning of outdoor practise until the
big event was over with, did he go “fine” for a moment.
Twelve days before the meet Allan had his last trial,
and when, still running strongly, he crossed the finish
line, Billy’s watch clicked at 9:53⅝.</p>

<p>Billy smiled cheerfully enough, but down in his
heart he was disappointed. He had expected better
things.</p>

<small>SUNSHINE AND SHADOW</small></h2>


<p>I have never found any one with sufficient courage
to defend the winters at Centerport. At the best they
are bearable, at the worst they are beyond description.
Nothing any one might say would be too harsh to apply
to what the residents call “a hard winter.”</p>

<p>In short, from January to April the weather is
everything detestable, and reminds one of a very bad
little boy who has made up his very bad little mind to
be as very bad as he possibly can.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;as like as not between a sunset and a
sunrise&mdash;spring appears, and it is just as though the
very bad little boy had grown sorry and repentant and
had made up his mind to be very, very good and sweet
and kind, and never do anything to grieve his dear, <em>dear</em>
parents any more. And there is a soft, warm breeze
blowing up the river valley, the grass on the southern
side of the library is unmistakably green, a bluebird, or
maybe a valiant robin, is singing from a branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
big elm at the corner of the chapel, and there is a strong,
heartening aroma of moist earth in your nostrils. And
you know that from thenceforth until you leave the old
green town the last of June your lines are cast in pleasant
places and that it is going to be very easy to be happy
and good.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose there are other places where spring
is superlatively pleasant, where the trees and sod are
extravagantly green, and where youth finds life so well
worth living. Only&mdash;I have never found them. And
I doubt if there is an old Erskine man the country over
who can recollect the month of May at Centerport without
a little catch of the breath and a sudden lighting of
the eye.</p>

<p>For in those Mays his memory recalls Main Street
and the yard were canopied with a swaying lacework of
whispering elm branches, through which the sunlight
dripped in golden globules and splashed upon the soft,
velvety sod or moist gravel and spread itself in limpid
pools. And the ivy was newly green against the old red
brick buildings, the fence below College Place was lined
with fellows you knew, and the slow-moving old blue
watering-cart trundled by with a soft and pleasant sound
of splashing water. Fellows called gaily to you as you
crossed the yard, the muslin curtains at the windows of
Morris and Sesson were a-flutter in the morning breeze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and from Elm Street floated the musical and monotonous
chime of the scissor-grinder’s bells. What if the Finals
were close at hand? The sky was blue overhead, the
spring air was kind and&mdash;you were young!</p>

<p>I think something of this occurred to Allan when,
at a quarter of ten on a mild, bright morning three days
before the dual meet, he crossed the street from his room,
books under arm, and turned into College Place.</p>

<p>Perched on the fence in front of the chapel were
Clarke Mason, the editor of the Purple, and Stearns,
the track team captain. After exchanging greetings,
Allan dropped his books back of the fence and swung
himself onto the top rail.</p>

<p>The sun was pleasant, the ten o’clock bell would not
ring for several minutes, and there was an invitation in
the way in which Mason edged away from the post.
Allan was a warm admirer of Mason, and the fact that,
as was natural, he seldom had an opportunity to speak
with him made him glad of the present opportunity.
There was but one topic of overwhelming interest at
present, and that was the track and field meet with
Robinson. With two successive defeats against them,
and the added result of the last football game still in
memory, it is not strange that Erskine men had set
their hearts on administering a trouncing to the Brown
and regaining something of their old athletic prestige.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The boat race and the baseball contests were too far
distant for present consideration.</p>

<p>“I don’t know when there’s been so much enthusiasm
over the athletic meet as there is this year,”
said Mason. “And it’s bound to tell, too. I’ve noticed
that when the college as a whole wakes up and wants a
thing it generally comes pretty near getting it.”</p>

<p>“We wanted the football game badly enough,” said
Stearns.</p>

<p>“Yes, just as we want all of them, but there wasn’t
the enthusiasm there has been some years. I think we
expected to win, and so didn’t get much wrought up over
it. But next year&mdash;although you and I won’t be here
to see it, Walt&mdash;I’ll bet the college will be red-headed
over football; there’ll be mass-meetings and the band
up from Hastings, and Ware here will be marching out
to the field singing ‘Glory, Glory for the Purple’ at the
top of his lungs. And the team will just naturally go
in and win.”</p>

<p>“At that rate,” ventured Allan, “we ought to lick
Robinson on Saturday, for, as you say, the fellows are
all worked up over it.”</p>

<p>“I think we’re going to,” answered Mason, with
quiet conviction. “But, of course, I don’t know so much
about it as Walt here, and he says I’m off my reckoning.”</p>

<p>Allan looked at the captain with surprise. All along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Stearns had displayed a confidence that, in Allan’s case
at least, had been a great incentive to hard work.
Stearns frowned a little as he answered:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe to-morrow I’ll be hopeful again.
A fellow can’t help having a spell of nerves now and
then, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s only that, we’ll forgive you,” Mason
replied. “I thought maybe something had happened.
Things have a way of happening, I’ve noticed, just before
a meet; Jones lames his ankle, Brown is put on
probation, Smith is protested, or something else unforeseen
plays havoc.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Stearns, emphatically, “and maybe
one reason I feel uneasy is because nothing <em>has</em> happened;
Robinson hasn’t protested any one and no one
has sprained his ankle or got water on the knee. I
think I’d feel safer if something of the sort had
occurred.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re safe now,” laughed Mason.
“The men have quit practise and Robinson’s opportunity
for protesting our best men has passed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Stearns, doubtfully. “Something
will turn up, you see if it doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! How about you, Ware? Going to win
the two miles?”</p>

<p>“I’m scared to think about it,” answered Allan, uneasily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
“That Robinson crack can do better than I’ve
succeeded in doing yet, and so I guess I’ll have to be
satisfied with second place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ware’s all right,” said Stearns, encouragingly.
“He’s going to present us with five points, and we’ll
need ’em!”</p>

<p>This sounded more like the Stearns Allan was
accustomed to.</p>

<p>“They tell me that chum of yours, Burley, is going
to do great things with the shot, Ware,” said Mason,
questioningly.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Allan answered. “He can, all right;
the only thing is whether he will get fussed and forget
how; he’s funny that way.”</p>

<p>“Well, Billy thinks he’s a wonder, and says that by
next year he’ll be able to give a foot to the best college
man in the country. Well, there’s the bell. I hate to
waste a day like this indoors, but&mdash;needs must when
the faculty drives!”</p>

<p>The trio slipped off the fence and went their separate
ways, but before they parted Stearns drew Allan aside.</p>

<p>“I say, Ware,” he said, “don’t say anything to any
one about what&mdash;what you’ve heard. There’s no use in
discouraging them, you know, and what I just said
doesn’t amount to anything; I guess I’m feeling a bit
nervous. You understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>But Allan, as he crossed the yard to College Hall, in
the tower of which the bell was clanging its imperative
summons, couldn’t help feeling apprehensive and worried.
It was so unlike Stearns to admit even the possibility
of defeat. On the steps Allan ran against Pete,
big, smiling, and serenely satisfied with life.</p>

<p>“How’d you get on yesterday?” asked Allan, as
they went in together.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty middlin’,” said Pete, cheerfully. “I
got within four inches of that cayuse of a Monroe.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to beat him if you expect to win
over Robinson,” said Allan, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not bothering about Robinson,” answered
Pete. “If I can do up Monroe, that’s all I give a
hang about!”</p>

<p>The next afternoon, Thursday, Stearns appeared at
Allan’s room, looking excessively cheerful.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, as he sat down. “How are
things?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the other, wondering at the
track captain’s errand. “How about you?”</p>

<p>“Fine as silk,” he said. “Say, Ware, Robinson has
sent a foolish letter, and asks the committee to look up
your record. Of course,” he went on, carelessly and hurriedly,
“it’s all poppycock, but they think they have a
case, and so maybe you’d better walk over with me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
see Nast about it; just explain things so he can write
back to ’em, you know. Are you busy?”</p>

<p>Allan, bewildered and dismayed, looked across at
Stearns with wide eyes and sinking heart. The track
team captain’s forebodings of yesterday flashed into
memory, and it was with a very weak voice that he asked
finally:</p>

<p>“You mean that&mdash;that Robinson has protested me?”</p>

<p>Stearns laughed carelessly, but something in the
other’s tone sent a qualm of uneasiness to his heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no question of a protest,” he answered,
“because the time for protests has gone by. But, of
course, they knew the committee would investigate the
matter, and that if everything wasn’t all right they
wouldn’t allow you to run. But, of course, as I say, it’s
all nonsense. They say you were entered in the mile
run at the St. Thomas Club Meet, in Brooklyn, during
vacation, and came in third. And&mdash;and there’s a silly
newspaper clipping with your name in it. But, as I
told Nast, you can explain that all right, I guess. Fact
is, you know,” he continued, with a little annoyed laugh,
“you’ve got to; we can’t afford to lose you, Ware.”</p>

<p>Allan took his cap from the desk.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said, quietly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>A NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH</small></h2>


<p>During the short walk across the yard little was said.
Stearns now and then shot puzzled and anxious glances
at Allan’s face, but the latter looked straight ahead of
him, and Stearns learned nothing. In the office Professor
Nast approached the subject at once. The Robinson
authorities, he stated, had written, saying that Ware
had won third prize in the mile event at an indoor meet
of the St. Thomas Club, in Brooklyn, on the evening of
December 26th, and in support of the contention enclosed
a clipping from a newspaper. The clipping was handed
to Allan, and he read, opposite a big blue pencil mark:</p>

<p>“Mile run&mdash;Won by E. C. Scheur, N. Y. C. C. A.
(45 yds.); second, T. Webb, St. T. A. A. (45 yds.);
third, A. Ware, E. A. A. (50 yds.). Time&mdash;4m. 47s.”</p>

<p>Allan returned the clipping calmly.</p>

<p>“You understand,” said the professor, gently, “that
the mere fact of your having entered this meeting without
permission would not of itself render you ineligible
on Saturday. The trouble is that the meeting”&mdash;here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he tapped the newspaper clipping with his pencil&mdash;“was
not an amateur affair; the prizes were purses of
money, and, being an ‘open’ meeting, there were, as
you may see, a number of professionals participating.
That&mdash;er&mdash;is the difficulty.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it,” said Allan, quietly.</p>

<p>Stearns sank back in his chair with a long sigh of
relief. “I told you it was all nonsense!” he exclaimed.
The professor himself looked well pleased.</p>

<p>“I did not run in that meeting,” continued Allan.
“I have been in Brooklyn but once, and that was fully
six years ago.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said the professor,
“very glad. Now, while I am not in duty bound to explain
the matter to the Robinson authorities, yet it is
better for various reasons to do so. And there is one
thing&mdash;” He paused and tapped the desk frowningly.
“About this clipping?” he asked. Allan shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t explain that. Perhaps there’s
another ‘A. Ware’ and perhaps ‘E. A. A.’ stands for
something else besides Erskine Athletic Association.”</p>

<p>“Stands for lots of things, probably,” said Stearns,
a bit impatiently.</p>

<p>“We might find that out,” mused the professor.
“Where were you, Ware, that evening, the&mdash;ah&mdash;yes,
the twenty-sixth of December?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was in New York, visiting my aunt on Seventy-third
Street. I was in the house all the evening, except
for about half an hour, when I went out on an errand.”</p>

<p>“Well, you couldn’t have crossed the river to Brooklyn,
run a mile race and returned home in half an hour,”
said the professor, lightly. “Now, will you get your
aunt to write me a letter, stating those facts and assuring
me that you were not and could not have been in Brooklyn?
It is not, you understand, that I doubt your word,
Ware, but I have my duties in these affairs and I must
perform them. Simply a letter, you understand, will
suffice.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” Allan replied; “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eh?” shouted Stearns.</p>

<p>“But my aunt has left New York city and is
traveling in the West, probably in California now. I
shall have to find her address from my mother first, and
by that time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, sir,” interrupted Stearns. “Surely
Ware’s word of honor is enough in a case of this sort?
It’s only a&mdash;a coincidence of names, sir.”</p>

<p>“For my own satisfaction Mr. Ware’s word is sufficient,”
replied the chairman, with dignity, “but the
rules require evidence, and I must have it. I only ask
Mr. Ware to supply me with a statement from some
person who knows of his whereabouts on the evening in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
question. Perhaps there is some other person who will
do as well?” But Allan shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m afraid not. My aunt lives alone except
for the servants, and I saw no one I knew that
evening. I will telegraph to my mother at once, and
perhaps I will be able to get a letter from my aunt
before Saturday. But it’s a pretty short time.”</p>

<p>“Produce your evidence any time before the two-mile
race is called,” said the chairman, kindly, “and it
will be all right. And, by the way, a telegram will
answer as well as a letter, if your&mdash;er&mdash;aunt is in the
West. I am anxious to help you in every way possible,
and I regret that the duties of my office require me to
be or&mdash;er&mdash;seem exacting. Another thing, Ware; the
Athletic Association will incur all the expenses of telegraphing
in this affair; and you need not&mdash;ah&mdash;spare
money. Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will be all right,” said Stearns, cheerfully,
as they hurried together to the telegraph office. But
Allan shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve felt ever since yesterday that something
would happen to ball things up. And now it’s happened.
And I don’t believe I’ll hear from my aunt in
time. However, I wouldn’t have got better than second
place, anyway. But I did want to run,” he ended,
dolorously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nonsense! Cheer up! We’ll make the wires hum.
We’ve got pretty near two whole days, and we can telegraph
around the world fifty times in two days.”</p>

<p>The telegram asking for his aunt’s address was duly
despatched to his mother in New Haven, and after that
there was nothing left to do save wait her reply. Allan
parted from Stearns and went dejectedly back to his
room. There he found Pete engaged in a carouse with
Two Spot. They wouldn’t let Pete practise with the
shot to-day, or again before the meet, and he was feeling
quite lost in consequence. Allan wanted some one to
unfold his tale of woe to, and he was glad to find Pete
awaiting him. Pete, as the story was told, grew very
indignant, and offered to punch Professor Nast’s head.
But Allan finally convinced him that the chairman of
the Athletic Committee wasn’t at all to blame.</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly way to have things end, after you’ve
been practising hard all spring,” he said, as he arose
impatiently from his chair and strolled to the desk. A
Latin book was lying on the blotter, with a slip of paper
marking the page where Allan had been at work when
Stearns appeared. Now he opened the book, crumpled
the marker into a ball and tossed it disgustedly onto the
floor. Then he drew up a chair and plainly hinted that
he desired to study. Pete, however, refused to heed
the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a mighty foolish business,” he said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Allan grunted.</p>

<p>Two Spot had discovered the little ball of paper and
was making believe that it was a mouse. She rolled it
from under the couch with playful pawings and frantic
rushes, and finally tossing it in the air, so that it fell
at Pete’s feet, she stopped, blinked at it and suddenly
fell to washing her feet, as though too dignified to do
aught else. Pete stooped absent-mindedly and picked
up the bit of paper, unfolding it slowly and smoothing
it across one huge knee.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” he said presently, “you chaps have
forgotten one thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Allan asked, ungraciously.</p>

<p>“To wire the St. Thomas Club people and ask them
if you ran in their old meeting.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s so,” said Allan, hopefully. “But,
then, there was probably some one there named ‘A.
Ware,’ and they’d just answer ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>“Ask ’em if Allan Ware, of Erskine, ran in the
meeting, and, if he didn’t, who the dickens the ‘A. Ware’
was who did run. Tell you’ve got to know in a hurry,
and that it’s blamed important.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Allan, “that’s a good idea.
Funny we didn’t think of it, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>For answer Pete grunted, as though he didn’t think
it at all funny.</p>

<p>“Hello, who’s ‘Horace L. Pearson, N. Y. A. C.’?”
asked Pete, holding up the scrap of paper rescued from
Two Spot, and which now proved to be torn from the
program of the Boston indoor meeting.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; why?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“I used to know a fellow of that name out in Colorado.
He was sort of studying mining. What does
‘N. Y. A. C.’ mean?”</p>

<p>“New York Athletic Club. It’s probably the same
fellow. I remember him now. He was the chap that
thought Rindgely was me.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked Pete. “How was that?”</p>

<p>So Allan told him, and Pete grew very thoughtful
as the short narrative progressed. When Allan had finished
he asked:</p>

<p>“I suppose these fellows that do stunts at the Boston
meet go to pretty near all of them, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; a good many, I guess. Why?”</p>

<p>“Just wondering,” answered Pete. “Come on and
send that telegram. If you address it to the president
or treasurer or something, it will do, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll send it to the chairman of the Athletic Committee,”
said Allan, seizing his hat. “I’m glad you
thought of it, Pete. You’re some good in the world,
after all, aren’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure. See you this evening. I want to see
Tommy. Where do you suppose I’ll find him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on down to the telegraph office.”</p>

<p>“Can’t; I want Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Well, try the Purple office; maybe he’s there.
Don’t forget to come around to-night. I may get an
answer from my mother by that time.”</p>

<p>Pete was successful. To be sure, Tommy wasn’t in
the office of the Purple, but Pete hadn’t supposed he
would be; Tommy wasn’t so easily caught. But by
tracing him from one place to another, Pete at last came
up with him in the library, where he was eagerly securing
data for an article on rowing which he was preparing
for a Boston Sunday paper.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, hurriedly, “I don’t know
very much about rowing, but it wouldn’t do to say so,
and so I come here and consult these gentlemen.” He
indicated the half-dozen volumes by which he was surrounded.
“If I only wrote what I knew, you see, I’d
never make any money.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the first time I ever heard you
acknowledge you didn’t know it all, from throwing to
tying,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“Oh, a fellow has to keep up a front,” said Tommy,
shrewdly, with a grin.</p>

<p>Pete slipped into the next chair, and for the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
quarter of an hour they whispered fast and furiously.
When Pete got up, he said:</p>

<p>“This isn’t for publication in your old paper,
Tommy, you know. And don’t say anything about it
to any one, will you?”</p>

<p>And Tommy pledged himself to secrecy, adding:</p>

<p>“And I think you’ve got it, Pete. Are you going to
see him to-night?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I can find him in his room,” Pete
replied.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come around to Allan’s to-night and
hear what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I won’t tell Allan,” answered Pete. “Anyhow,
not unless I have to. I’ll see what the coyote has
to say for himself.”</p>

<p>“Rindgely? Oh, he’ll have plenty to say, all right.
He’ll talk himself blue in the face if you let him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I won’t let him,” answered Pete, grimly.</p>

<small>THE FRESHMAN GAME</small></h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your aunt was in Los Angeles California Monday
expected stay week address Mission House. Is
anything wrong? <span class="flright smcap">Mother.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>This message Allan found awaiting him when he
hurried home from dinner that evening. So far so
good, he reflected. But Monday was three days gone,
and if his aunt had changed her mind and gone on!&mdash;well,
he didn’t like to consider that contingency. Seating
himself at his desk, he composed two messages, one
to his aunt and one to the manager of the Mission
House. In the latter he requested that his message to
Miss Mary G. Merrill be forwarded to her, in case she
had left the hotel. In the other message he finally expressed,
at the expense of thirty-four words, what he
wanted his aunt to do. Then he hurried again to the
telegraph office and begged the emotionless operator to
get both messages off at once. The operator nodded
silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“You haven’t received any other message for me,
have you?” asked Allan. The operator as silently
shook his head. Allan wandered back to his room.
Studying was a task this evening, and he was glad when
Tommy demanded admittance. A few minutes later
Pete, too, arrived, looking very satisfied with life.
Allan did not notice the exchange of glances between
the last comer and Tommy, and if he had he would not
have understood them, nor would he have connected
them with the matter uppermost in his thoughts.
Tommy raised his eyebrows inquiringly and Pete
nodded with a smile and mysteriously tapped the breast
of his coat.</p>

<p>Allan was full of his quandary and found much
relief in telling everything to Tommy and exhibiting
the telegrams received and copies of those sent. Pete,
strange to say, and somewhat to Allan’s disappointment,
did not display the amount of interest in the subject
which Allan thought he should have; and even Tommy
seemed soon to tire of the matter. Allan fell into
silence, reflecting pessimistically on the readiness of
your friends to abandon your troubles. Pete and
Tommy left early&mdash;Tommy had been on the point of
leaving ever since his arrival&mdash;and with their parting
injunctions to “cheer up” and “don’t let it bother
you” in his ears, Allan went sorrowfully to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was Friday, and it dawned cloudy
and chill. May has its moods, even in Centerport, but
it was unfortunate that it should have displayed the
fact to-day, for the gloominess of the weather increased
Allan’s despondency until Two Spot, blinking inquiringly
from the Morris chair, saw that the world was
awry and decided to go to sleep until things were
righted again. And the answer to his St. Thomas Club
message, which came just before noon, did not tend to
lighten Allan’s spirits.</p>

<p>“Ware of Erskine,” it ran, “won third in mile
run December twenty-sixth.”</p>

<p>Allan, as he tossed the sheet of buff paper angrily
aside, wondered whether, after all, he had not taken
part in the meeting while temporarily unbalanced; he
had heard of such things, he thought. Or perhaps he
had fallen asleep and&mdash;but no, his imagination couldn’t
conceive of any one running a mile race and negotiating
inclined corners without waking up! It was a strange
and maddening mystery, and the more he puzzled over
it the stranger it seemed and the more exasperated he
became.</p>

<p>Stearns called after lunch and listened to an account
of the developments with perfunctory interest. He
had given up hope of having Allan enter the meet, and
had decided that it didn’t much matter. For it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
evident that Allan was worried and nervous, and the
chances that he would give a good account of himself, if
he ran, were slim. Stearns was sympathetic, but Allan
could see that he, like Pete and Tommy, wasn’t inclined
to let the matter trouble him overmuch.</p>

<p>After the track captain had left, Allan fell into still
deeper despondency and mooned about his room&mdash;which
was the last thing he should have done&mdash;until four
o’clock, when a half-hour of jogging on the track took
him out. No reply from Aunt Mary had reached him
by dinner time, and although he stayed awake until
eleven, in violation of training orders, listening eagerly
for the opening of the gate which should announce the
advent of the messenger, he was at last forced to go to
sleep without the message. You may be certain his
sleep did him little good. He dreamed all night, or so
it seemed, and morning found him tired and haggard.
His first look was toward the door-sill, but no buff envelope
rewarded it.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he muttered, bitterly; “I’m not
going to hope any longer.”</p>

<p>Having reached this decision, he threw back his
shoulders and walked to breakfast whistling a tune. To
be sure, the tune wasn’t always tuneful, and sometimes
it died out entirely, but it was a brave effort. Breakfast
at the training table was an uncomfortable meal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
him. The others were in the best of spirits, and there
was present a half-suppressed excitement that showed
itself on the countenances and in the bearing of the
fellows.</p>

<p>None there save Stearns and Pete knew of Allan’s
trouble, and they gave no sign. Pete even seemed to
Allan to be indecently happy, and his attempts at conversation
met with scant encouragement. Half-way
through the meal Rindgely’s absence was discovered,
and Kernahan was despatched to hunt him up. He
had not returned when Allan left the house. Every one
was cautioned to spend the forenoon out-of-doors and
report promptly at eleven-thirty for lunch.</p>

<p>The town soon took on a gala appearance. The
sidewalks were thronged by ten o’clock, and none
seemed to have anything to do save discuss the outcome
of the afternoon’s performances. Erskine banners hung
from the shop windows and fluttered over front doors.
Pete wanted Allan to go out to the field with him and
see the Erskine-Robinson freshman game, but Allan had
no heart for it, and refused to leave his room. He had
no recitations, for the professors had very generally
given cuts. He wrote a letter to his mother&mdash;a very
dismal production it was, too&mdash;and then sat at the window
with Two Spot in his lap and watched the crowds
pass on their way to the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The college band, followed by a mob of singing,
cheering freshmen, went by in a cloud of dust, and
presently a barge containing the home nine passed, and
Allan had a glimpse of Hal’s gray-clad shoulders. The
Robinson youngsters had already gone out. The steady
stream of townfolk and students became broken;
groups of three and four passed at intervals; now and
then a couple of students, laughing and chatting, or a
solitary mortal hurried by the house. Then, quite suddenly,
as it seemed, all traffic ceased, and Poplar Street
resumed its wonted quiet.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Allan’s eyes, roaming from the
magazine which he was striving to read, sighted a faded
blue coat across the little park, and his heart leaped into
his throat. A messenger boy, whistling a blithe tune,
toiled slowly along, as though his shoulders bore the
weight of a great sorrow. Once, when almost at the
corner, he stopped, leaned against the fence and seemed
on the point of going to sleep. Then he roused himself
and came on. Allan restrained an impulse to dart out
into the road and waited on the porch, with his heart
beating like a trip-hammer. The boy reached the corner,
glanced with mild interest at Allan&mdash;and went on
up Main Street.</p>

<p>After the first moment of blank and sickening dismay,
Allan went to the end of the porch and looked after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
him. Perhaps, after all, he was mistaken, and would
discover the fact and turn back. But eventually the lad
sauntered across the street and disappeared around the
corner of McLean. Allan went back to his chair, his
heart like lead and a lump in his throat that wouldn’t
be swallowed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out at Erskine Field great things were happening.
The purple-lettered youngsters were more than holding
their own against the far-heralded team of Robinson.
It was the sixth inning, and the score stood 9 to 5 in
Erskine’s favor. Hal had played a magnificent game at
second and already had a double-play to his credit, and
had, besides, succeeded beyond all of his team-mates at
hitting the redoubtable brown-stockinged pitcher. Side
by side on the warm turf back of third-base, Tommy
and Pete were sitting cross-legged, having passed the
ropes by virtue of Tommy’s ever-present note-book, with
its staring inscription, “Erskine Purple,” on the
cover. The last man of the Erskine side went out, the
teams changed places, the seventh inning began with
Robinson’s tail-enders coming to the plate, and Pete
resumed his narrative, which had been interrupted by
Hal’s hard drive to left-field.</p>

<p>“He didn’t have any idea what I had come for,”
Pete said, “and was going to be very nice and polite;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
he can be when he likes, you know. But I wasn’t there
to pass compliments or swap stories, so I got right down
out of the saddle and talked business. ‘Rindgely, I
know that you ran in the St. Thomas Club meet in
Brooklyn the night after Christmas, under the name
of A. Ware, and won fifteen dollars,’ I said, ‘and you’ve
got to come out in the open and say so.’ Of course, it
was a rank bluff; I was pretty certain about it after I’d
talked with you, but I didn’t know absolutely, and
couldn’t prove anything. If he had kept his nerve and
told me to go to thunder, it would have been all off on
the spot, and I’d had to crawl off with my tail between
my legs. But it took him so sudden that he just
gasped and got pale around the gills. Then I knew I
had him roped. So I just waded in and gave it to him
hot and heavy. Told him he was a horse-thief and an
all-round galoot; that he ought to be ashamed of himself,
and a lot more. When I got through he was a pretty
sick steer. I had him hog-tied and branded. Then he
began to play fair.&mdash;Ginger! look at that hit! Good
work! That’s two out, ain’t it? Only one? Well, it
ought to be two.”</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked Tommy, making strange
marks in the score-book on his knee.</p>

<p>“Well, I got kind of sorry for the poor old jack-rabbit.
He told me all about it, and swore up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
he hadn’t meant any harm; that he wanted to try what
he could do against some good men at the mile, and
hadn’t cared a hang about the money. ‘But what did
you use Ware’s name for?’ says I. ‘Wasn’t your own
bad enough?’ ‘Because,’ says he, ‘I didn’t want my
folks to know about it; they live there in Brooklyn, and
might have seen my name in the paper next day. I
didn’t think about making myself ineligible,’ says he,
‘and I didn’t think I was doing Ware any harm.’ Well,
that may be a lie, but he was sure in the dumps, and so
I agreed to make things easy for him. ‘You write it
all out in black and white and sign your name to it,’
says I, ‘and if I can I’ll keep dark about it. If Allan
gets a message from his aunt, all right; if he doesn’t, I
show your document to Nast. I’ll wait till the two-mile
is called.’ Bully for you, Hal! That’s three, ain’t it?
Sure! Hit it out, Seven!”</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, after the nines had changed
places and the Erskine captain had seized his bat, “you
see, I didn’t want to be any harder on Rindgely than I
had to. He said if the faculty got hold of it they’d be
sure to either bounce him bodily or hold up his diploma.
Well, I guess they would, all right, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure to,” answered Tommy, promptly, as he
marked the first man out at first, scored an assist to the
credit of the opposing pitcher and a put-out to that of
the Brown’s first-baseman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“So that’s the way we fixed it up. And I hope
Allan gets word from auntie, for I’m blessed if I want
Rindgely to get kicked out without graduating. It
would be hard luck for a chap to do four years at hard
labor here and then slip up just when he was going to
grab the prize, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hardest kind of luck,” said Tommy. “Hope you
don’t have to show the confession.”</p>

<p>Erskine went out in one, two, three order and the
eighth inning commenced. The band was doing gallant
work and Pete found conversation beyond his powers
until the last strains of a lively two-step had died away.
By that time the Brown’s second man had been retired,
and Robinson’s hopes were dwindling fast.</p>

<p>“Is he going to run this afternoon?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>Pete shook his head.</p>

<p>“No; you see, I couldn’t let him do that; it would
be against the law; if Allan couldn’t run he couldn’t,
and that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t any right to,” said Tommy, thoughtfully.
“He’s plainly ineligible because he ran for
money; and then, there would be other reasons.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way I figured it out,” said Pete,
with a note of relief in his voice. He was glad to have
his decision supported by some one who knew more about
such things. “But he saw himself that it was all up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with him as a runner. He said he’d be sick to-day, and,
as he wasn’t at breakfast, I guess he is. I’ll bet Dr.
Prentiss will have a hard time finding out what’s wrong
with him.” And Pete chuckled wickedly.</p>

<p>“All out,” said Tommy. “Say, Hal! Oh, <em>Hal</em>!
Give us a home run, Hal! Get out! Of course you
can. We want some more runs.”</p>

<p>“I guess we don’t stand much show of winning this
afternoon,” went on Pete. “With Rindgely out of it
and Allan all balled up, I can see Robinson getting a
few points.”</p>

<p>“They’ll win first in the mile, all right,” answered
Tommy. “Hooker’s not in the same class with Rindgely
this spring, and Harris isn’t a bit better; though maybe
he’ll manage to get placed. As for Allan, he never has
had any too good a chance at the two miles, and now,
after all this rumpus, it’s a fair bet he’ll be out of it
entirely. It’s a mean shame the way things have gone,
and when you think that it’s all Rindgely’s fault, expulsion
doesn’t seem a bit too bad for him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Pete, doubtfully, “but I don’t want
to be the feller to get him bounced; that’s all. If Allan’s
confounded old relative doesn’t come to time I’ll&mdash;well,
I guess I’ll give Rindgely’s statement to you and let
you attend to things.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got another guess, Pete,” said Tommy. “<em>I</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
don’t want anything to do with it. Besides, you worked
the racket and ought to see it out.”</p>

<p>Pete sighed dolefully.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Again the inning closed without a tally, and Robinson
came in for her last turn at bat. Her players looked
very determined, and it seemed not impossible that they
would go in and make up the four runs that threatened
to defeat them. And the band played again. Pete and
Tommy were driven from their places by the crowd,
which had left the stands and were invading the field,
and they allowed themselves to be pushed forward to
the foul-line.</p>

<p>“I suppose Allan thinks I’m a brute,” said Pete,
dismally. “I didn’t go near him last night. But I just
couldn’t stand seeing him so miserable, and not blurting
out everything I knew. So I fought shy. I just hope it
ends all right.”</p>

<p>Whether that ended all right another chapter will
have to tell, but there was no doubt about the game
ending that way. Robinson went down before superb
pitching, and with the score still 9 to 5, the spectators
flooded over the field and their cheers drowned even
the band.</p>

<small>“ON YOUR MARK!”</small></h2>


<p>Once more the crowds were moving out to Erskine
Field. It was after one o’clock, and experienced persons
knew that there were no reserved seats and that “first
come first served” was the rule. The midday sun
shone warmly and only enthusiasts looked forward with
pleasure to sitting on the unshaded stands for the next
three hours. Robinson’s athletes went out William
Street in two barges, their paraphernalia following them
in a tumble-down express wagon drawn by a limping
sorrel nag, whose bridle was draped with brown and
white.</p>

<p>The contents of the barges were viewed with polite
interest, but the wagon awakened amusement on the part
of sober citizens and ribald mirth on the part of undignified
undergraduates. Nearing the field, the eyes
caught sight above the tree-tops of the great purple banner,
with its snowy E, which fluttered lazily at the top
of the tall staff. At half after one the stands were
thickly sprinkled with spectators, and the flutter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
programs&mdash;used in lieu of fans&mdash;was visible across the
field; with a little imagination one could have likened
the ladies, in their bright and many-colored gowns and
hats, to flowers, and thought the fluttering programs
lighter petals stirred in a breeze.</p>

<p>On the track, runners and sprinters were jogging to
and fro and on the edge of the field the officials were
gathering, their purple and gold badges glowing bravely
in the sunlight. Two big tents had been erected at the
end of the oval nearest the gates, and about them white-garbed
contestants lay or sat on outspread dressing-gowns,
while rubbers and trainers came and went
among them like anxious hens among their broods.</p>

<p>In front of the Erskine dressing-tent sat Allan. He
had been up and down the straightaway three times and
was still breathing heavily as a result. He had no
hope now of being allowed to enter his event, and even
if he were, he reflected, he would stand small show of
winning, since it was evident that he was in poor shape.
Physically he seemed fit enough, but he was aware all
the time of a feeling of nervousness and depression that
was ill-calculated to help him in a grueling two miles.</p>

<p>Word had been left at the telegraph office that if a
message came for him it was to be rushed out to the
field as fast as possible, and to this end a horse and buggy
from Pike’s stable was already standing in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
door. Stearns was taking no chances, for now that
Rindgely had been declared too ill to enter the contest,
another five points were almost certain to go to Robinson,
and if it was possible for Allan to enter the two
miles and make a fight for a place, he must do it.
Stearns was worried and down-hearted.</p>

<p>Even the most optimistic calculators could not figure
a victory for Erskine with first places in both the long-distance
events conceded to her rival. As a last resort,
Stearns had secured the postponement of the two miles
to the tag end of the afternoon. He had thrown himself
on the generosity of the Robinson captain and explained
the predicament.</p>

<p>And the Robinson captain, who was Brooks, their
crack hurdler, had consented, a piece of sportsmanship
which met with the condemnation of his trainer and
many of the team. But the expedient promised to work
little good, for it was plain that if Allan’s telegram to
his aunt had reached her she would have replied not
later than yesterday. But Stearns was in desperate
straits and no chance was too slight for him to seize upon.</p>

<p>At a few minutes after two o’clock the pistol was
heard from the far end of the straightaway, and Erskine
took the first honors of the meet, Stearns securing first
place and Leroy second in the 100 yards dash, and
earning 8 points for the Purple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>To chronicle the afternoon’s proceedings in detail
would be a tiresome as well as an unnecessary task. In
the 120 yards hurdles, which followed the first dash,
and in the 220 yards hurdles, which came later on the
program, Robinson had things pretty much her own
way, Brooks, her captain, taking first place handily in
each. Robinson won 12 points in these events, and
Erskine 6. Stearns again showed his mettle in the 220
dash, and Robinson got second and third; 5 points for
Erskine and 4 points for her adversary. In the quarter-mile
the best the home team could do was to secure third
place, and that by the narrowest margin, though the
time, 50⅖ seconds, was absurdly slow. When the
mile was called, the 220 yards hurdles had not been run
and the score on Professor Nast’s sheet stood: Erskine,
18; Robinson, 18. So far things were happening in a
way that brought joy to the professor’s heart, but the
field events were still undecided and the long distances
were yet to run.</p>

<p>The mile event worked the audience up to the highest
stage of excitement, and for a long while, in fact until
the three-quarters had been passed, the race was most
anybody’s. But after that Coolbroth of Robinson
sprang into the lead, closely pursued by Harris of
Erskine, and Patterson of Robinson. The finish was
made in that order, Harris and Patterson fighting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
second honors all the way around the last lap, and Harris
finally winning his 3 points by a bare two yards. The
hammer throw was decided about this time, and Robinson
was credited with first and third, Monroe winning
second for Erskine. The score now was not so satisfactory
to the supporters of the Purple, since it stood:
Erskine, 24; Robinson, 30.</p>

<p>The Purple exceeded expectations in the broad
jump, allowing her rival but 1 point. In the high
jump, however, she didn’t show up so well; Robinson
took first and third places. After the 220 yards hurdles,
which, as has been already told, were won by Brooks,
Erskine securing but 1 point, the score was heavily in
the Brown’s favor, 45 to 36. By this time the afternoon
had worn well toward sunset. Only the shot-put, the
880 yards run, the pole-vault and the two miles remained.
Of these, Robinson was conceded 8 points in
the pole-vault, 5 in the shot-put and 1 in the 880. It
was difficult to see how Erskine could pull out of the
meet ahead. In fact, it was evident that she couldn’t.
Even Tommy, normally optimistic, had lost hope. While
the competitors in the hurdles were trotting off to the
tents he hurried across to where the shot-putters were at
work. As he approached, six of the nine candidates
were donning their dressing-gowns, and he knew that the
trials were over and that the six were out of it. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
he pursed his lips and whistled softly. Of the three
competitors remaining for the finals, two were Erskine
men, Monroe and&mdash;yes, the other was Pete! The Robinson
candidate was Tiernan, who had won first in the
hammer throw. Pete hailed Tommy and drew him
aside.</p>

<p>“Have you got that paper safe?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Tommy reassured him by allowing a corner
of it to peep forth from his inside pocket. Pete nodded
and glanced toward the tent.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, don’t lose it,” he said. “And
keep a watch for the two miles. We’re not through here
yet and I don’t want the scheme to slip up.”</p>

<p>“All right. And say, Pete!”</p>

<p>“Yep?”</p>

<p>“Do your best, old man, won’t you?” begged
Tommy. “They’re ’way ahead of us, but if we get
first and third out of this we may have a fighting
chance.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” said Pete, untroubled. “I’ve got
Monroe dead to rights, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but beat Tiernan, Pete; we’ve <em>got</em> to win!”</p>

<p>“Well, just as you say, Tommy,” answered Pete,
smiling at the other’s look of tragedy. “For your sake,
Tommy, I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“Burley!” called the field judge, and Pete drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his sweater off and stepped into the ring. There were
three competitors remaining, and each was allowed
three tries, the best of which was to count. Pete picked
up the shot, took up his position at the rear of the circle,
placed the weight in his broad right hand, threw his left
arm out to balance him, raised his left foot from the
ground, and then, with a motion that was neither hop
nor glide, reached the front of the circle, brought his
right shoulder smartly round and sent the weight flying.
The measurer started to lay the end of the tape where
the shot had struck, but stopped at judge’s announcement.</p>

<p>“Foul,” said the latter. “You overstepped,
Burley.”</p>

<p>Pete nodded carelessly and donned his sweater
again. Kernahan, who had approached during the try,
beckoned to him, and they stepped aside.</p>

<p>“That won’t do, Pete,” said Billy. “Keep that
elbow in to the body; you had it spread way out that
time. And mind the stop. Take all the time you want,
you know; there’s no hurry.”</p>

<p>Pete grinned.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> all right,” he said. “Don’t worry about
me, Billy. I’ll get it away all right next time.”</p>

<p>Monroe followed with a put of 43 feet 6 inches, and
Tiernan bettered this by half a foot. Again Pete peeled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
his sweater off and took up the shot. As he stood there,
balancing himself, he looked, with a careless, good-natured
smile on his face, like a giant who, for his
amusement, had entered the sports of pigmies. He
was taller than Tiernan and bigger everywhere than
Monroe; the judge came barely to his shoulder. The
muscles of his arms were like great ropes under the
clear skin. Once more he crossed the ring, and once
more the leaden ball was hurled forward. From the
stands came a chorus of applause. Tommy’s face
lighted, and even Billy gave an appreciative nod. The
Robinson trainer, standing across the circle, shot a
quick glance at Pete as he stepped out and took his
sweater from the turf.</p>

<p>“Forty-four feet seven inches,” announced the
judge, as he held the tape to the edge of the stop-board.
Tommy clapped Pete on the shoulder and whispered
his delight. Pete smiled good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“All out for the 880!” cried a voice across the oval.
“Hurry up, half-milers!”</p>

<p>Monroe made his second try, and the tape said 44
feet 1 inch. He turned away in disgust. Pete smiled.
Robinson’s champion took plenty of time at his next
try, and made a splendid put. He had exceeded Pete’s
best attempt and there was a breathless silence around
the ring as the tape was adjusted. Then,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Forty-five feet two inches,” said the judge.</p>

<p>The Robinson trainer, who had looked anxious a
moment since, smiled demurely. Over on the starting
line the half-milers were being placed. Along the
length of the stands the spectators were leaving their
seats here and there. Pete stepped into the seven-foot
circle for his last try. Tommy, a few feet away,
watched him eagerly. With the shot in his right hand,
Pete looked across and dropped his left eyelid in a
portentous wink.</p>

<p>Tommy’s heart sank. If Pete would only stop his
fooling for a minute, he thought, and really put his
heart into it! And while the thought came to him, Pete
was hopping across the ring and poising himself for an
instant at the front edge. Then his body swung around,
his right arm shot out like a steel spring, and the shot
went arching over the ground. Tommy’s heart leaped
into his throat and then thumped wildly. From the
stands whose occupants were near enough to be able to
follow the shot-putting came a great roar of applause.
Tommy, with his eyes fixed intently on the tape, felt
a hand seize his arm and pull him around.</p>

<p>“Come along,” said Pete, “and find Nast.”</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait till we find out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Find out nothing,” said Pete. “Monroe can’t
touch that put!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>But even as Tommy hung back the judge looked up
from the tape with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Forty-five feet eleven inches!” he said.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh, bully!</em>” cried Tommy. “But Tiernan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Pete.</p>

<p>From across the field came the sharp report of the
pistol sending the half-milers away, and as Pete and
Tommy hurried to the tents the white-clad runners
swept by in a bunch on the first of their two laps, Poor
and Tolmann side by side in the lead, and Thatcher,
Erskine’s main hope, running warily well toward the
rear. Around the turns they went and entered the
back-stretch, hundreds of voices urging them on.</p>

<p>Allan, a depressed-looking figure in his dragging
drab gown, met them as they crossed the track. There
was no use asking him whether he had received the
longed-for message; one glance at his face was sufficient.
Pete took him aside out of the throng.</p>

<p>“You’re going to run, Allan,” he said, in low tones,
“so get warmed up. Now, don’t ask any questions, for
I can’t answer ’em yet. Just do as I tell you. It’s all
right; you’re going to run, and if you don’t win out I’ll&mdash;I’ll
lick you!”</p>

<p>The expression of hope which had at first leaped
into Allan’s face died out again, but a look of curiosity
remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“What&mdash;what do you mean?” he asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Just what I say. You’re going to run, and if you
want to do anything in the race get your muscles
stretched. Let go of me; I’m in a hurry. Have you
seen Nast?”</p>

<p>“I’ve found him,” said Tommy, hurrying up.
“He’s gone over to the finish. Here come the half-milers.
Track, there!”</p>

<p>Once more the runners sped past, but now they were
no longer bunched together. In front, leading by half
a dozen yards, ran Poor. Next came Thatcher, then a
Robinson man, then Tolmann. Behind Tolmann the
rest of the field pegged away, already out of the reckoning,
barring accidents.</p>

<p>“All out for the two miles!” bawled the clerk.</p>

<p>Pete shot a glance at Tommy and the latter nodded.
Together they turned away.</p>

<p>“Get a move on, Allan,” cried Pete. “Don’t stand
there like a wooden Indian!” Allan, his face expressing
wonder and returning hope, slipped quickly out of
his dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re joking, Pete,” he said, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Ware here?” piped a shrill voice, and the
blue-coated messenger boy pushed his way through the
throng about the tents. “Telegram for Mr. Ware!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>With a cry Allan turned and seized the envelope
from the boy’s hands and tore it open. Under the gaze
of dozens of curious eyes, he read the words on the still
damp sheet of yellow paper and turned with exultant
eyes to Pete and Tommy, who had paused at the edge of
the track.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” he cried. “Where’s Nast?” And
he sped off around the track. Tommy and Pete followed,
and the latter, as he went, took a folded sheet of
foolscap from his pocket and tore it into tiny pieces.</p>

<p>“Hurry up for the two miles!” bawled the clerk
again.</p>

<p>When Allan reached the finish he was unable for a
moment to reach Professor Nast, for the half-milers
were tearing down the home-stretch and the crowd was
thick about the tape. Shouts of triumph, roars of applause,
arose. Down the cinders, their straining forms
throwing long wavering shadows before them, came
Thatcher, Tolmann, and a Robinson runner, the first
two almost side by side, the third man four or five yards
behind. Then, in an instant more, the red string fluttered
away and Thatcher raced over the line, a winner
by a bare yard over his team-mate.</p>

<p>“Eight more points!” cried Tommy, gleefully.
“Who knows how the shot-put came out?”</p>

<p>“We got first and third,” answered Hal, turning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
“Hello, Tommy, is that you?” But Tommy was too
busy casting up figures on his score to do more than
nod.</p>

<p>“Was Pete first?” he asked in a moment.</p>

<p>“First! Gosh, he was first by almost a foot. Tiernan
fouled on his last try, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How about Monroe?” asked Pete, worming his
way forward.</p>

<p>“Hello, you old brick!” cried Hal, seizing his
hand. “Why, Monroe did something like forty-four
feet two, I think.”</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> all right,” said Pete.</p>

<p>By this time Allan had found Professor Nast, and
the latter was reading the message. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Allan was at my house New York evening December
twenty-sixth except between eight and eight-thirty
o’clock when he went errand for me Thirty-ninth street.
Could not have gone to Brooklyn and did not if he
says so. <span class="flright smcap">Mary G. Merrill.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>The professor handed back the sheet of paper and
put his hand on Allan’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said, with satisfaction. “Go in and
win, Ware.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>He pushed him toward where the long-distance men
were assembling at the start. Allan waited for no more,
but darted down the track. As he reached the group,
his name was called and he answered as he slipped into
the second line of runners. The next instant Stearns
was pulling him aside, his eyes wide with eagerness.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” he whispered. “Did you get
word?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a minute ago. I’ve seen Nast.”</p>

<p>Stearns gave him a hug that left him almost breathless.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” he said, softly. “The meet’s
tied at 54 points. The whole thing depends on this, and
we’ve got to have first place, Ware, we’ve <em>got</em> to! Watch
that man Burns over there; the tall chap with the tow
hair; he’s dangerous. And&mdash; Say, Billy,” turning to
the trainer, who had slipped across the track to them,
“Ware’s in it, after all. I was telling him to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get the lead at the start, or as soon as you can,
and just simply hold it, if you have to break a leg,” said
Billy, quietly. “How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” answered Allan. “But&mdash;I
guess I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“Good. See that light-haired Robinson man over
there at the pole? Well, play for him, Ware. And
don’t let him head you for a minute. All right now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“All ready, there?” called the starter, as he dropped
back and glanced at the pistol in his hand. There was
an instant of silence. Then,</p>

<p>“<em>On your mark!</em>” he cried.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>THE LAST EVENT</small></h2>


<p>Eleven men had entered for the two-mile run, six
from Robinson and five from Erskine. Of these, we
know Ware, Conroy, and Hooker, wearers of the purple
ribbon, and have just heard of Burns, the Brown’s
crack long-distance runner. In view of the result of
the race, it may be well to mention also Tammen, another
Robinson entry, who, until to-day, had been viewed
as a second-rater. For the others, they were big and
little, fair and dark, and all with their spurs still to
win. Taken together, they were a clean-built, healthy
lot as they stood at the starting line, their white running
pants and white shirts&mdash;the latter crossed by the purple
ribbon or the brown and white&mdash;just tinged with saffron
by the long rays of the setting sun. The starter glanced
again at his pistol.</p>

<p>“<em>Set!</em>” he cried.</p>

<p>And as the runners put their weights forward and
poised arms front and back, the pistol spoke and the
spiked shoes bit at the cinders as the men strove for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
inside of the track. The timers looked up from their
watches and the group about the line broke up. Ten
minutes&mdash;possibly a little less, perhaps a little more&mdash;must
elapse before the result could be known and
Erskine or Robinson could claim the meet. For by a
freak of fortune each college had now 54 points to its
credit, and final victory would go to that one whose
colors first brushed the string at the finish. Whether
the spring’s labor and planning was to be crowned with
victory or draped with defeat depended on who won
first place and its 5 points.</p>

<p>A knowledge of this accompanied Allan all through
the race, now spurring him on to determined effort, now
casting him into the depths of hopelessness and despair.
The meet depended upon him, and he wished with all
his heart that it didn’t. For from the first instant he
knew that he was not in a condition to do his best. He
was aware of high-strung nerves and a general feeling of
worry. For the latter there was no longer any reason;
but reason or no reason, it remained. The last two
days and their accompanying nights of unrefreshing
slumber had had their effect. For the rest, his muscles
were strong and supple, his lungs eager for
their task.</p>

<p>Half-way around the first lap he had secured the
lead, none disputing it with him, and had settled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
into that apparently slow pace which makes the two-mile
event look so unexciting at the first. He knew himself
capable of making that pace for the entire distance and
finishing comparatively fresh, but he also knew that
Burns, who was coming serenely along half-way back
down the length of the string, could stand it quite as
well, and could probably sprint in the last quarter mile
and beat him out. He decided then to increase the pace,
in the hope of wearing the Robinson crack out, yet
knowing that to make too fast a race would finish him
up just as surely as it would Burns.</p>

<p>When the home-stretch was reached in that first lap
Allan set his legs to faster work, and as he crossed the
line and completed the eighth of his distance, supporters
of the Purple shook their heads. It wouldn’t do, they
murmured; he would run himself out in the first mile
and a half. Even Kernahan was a little worried,
though nothing of the sort showed on his face. At the
end of the second lap Allan had not abated his speed
a jot.</p>

<p>As he passed the groups around the finish and the
tents, his eyes were set straight ahead, his long strides
clung closely to the inner rim of the track and he was
holding himself well erect. Into his cheeks the blood
was creeping and dyeing them crimson, save for two
disks that showed whiter and whiter as the contest wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on. Behind Allan ran an unknown Robinson man, then
Hooker, then Tammen, then Burns. Conroy was dangerously
far back, and, with others in his neighborhood,
was showing that he didn’t approve of the pace.</p>

<p>Of all distances, the two miles is the hardest to run.
Speed as a factor in success is largely eliminated, and
endurance is the supreme test. The race requires a
large courage on the part of the runner, the courage to
endure. It has been said, and truly, that it takes a fast
man for the sprints and a brave man for the distances.
At the completion of the fourth lap it is safe to say that
five of the six runners were as completely and hopelessly
beaten as though the race was finishing. Their legs
dragged, their heads were falling back, and their lungs
were aching. But it had been the fastest half of a two-mile
race ever run on Erskine Field.</p>

<p>Of those in the van of the long line of runners,
which now stretched half-way around the oval, only
three maintained their form at the beginning of the
fifth lap; those were Allan, Burns, and Tammen. Save
that the unknown Robinson man who had held second
place at the beginning had dropped back to fifth position,
the order was unchanged. Between Allan and his
team-mate, Hooker, there was three yards of cinders;
between Hooker and Tammen, five yards more. Back
of Tammen, only a stride separating them, ran Burns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
untroubled, and holding his own with great, long, easy
strides.</p>

<p>The turf was strangely green, for the low slanting
beams of the sun bathed it in their golden glow. The
stands were almost deserted, for the occupants were
clustered all along the home-stretch, their eager gaze
following the white-clad figures on the darkening track.</p>

<p>If Allan’s form was still nearly what it had been at
the beginning of the race, it must not be supposed that
the mile had not told. Usually the two-miler finishes
the half-distance in comparatively unwearied condition
and faces his troubles from then on, but Allan had set a
fast pace, and it had told on him, in spite of appearances.
He felt as he usually did at the end of the mile
and a half, and he wondered troubledly if he had not
overdone it.</p>

<p>At the turns, now and then, a backward glance revealed
the confident face of Burns, while Hooker’s tortured
breathing told its own tale. Either he must last
out or Robinson would take second and third positions,
as well as first. But he had grown fearful of his ability
to do so, and on the sixth lap he eased up on his pace.
And half-way down the back-stretch he wondered if he
had not, after all, made a mistake in doing so. For
Burns, refusing to slow down, had bested Tammen and
Hooker and was apparently striving to pass Allan. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
at the beginning of the next lap, the seventh, Allan saw
that the supreme struggle was not yet, for Burns had
slipped in behind him, apparently content to let him
set the pace for a while longer.</p>

<p>Then Hooker began to drop back. He had done his
best, but his best was not good enough. Tammen passed
him and ranged himself behind Burns, and these three,
when the last lap began, were leading the field by sixty
yards or more. As they swept by the finish the shouts
of the spectators made a deafening roar in their ears.
Allan had a dim vision of Pete leaping alongside the
track at the first turn, near the tents, waving his long
arms against the sunset glow and shouting unintelligible
things.</p>

<p>Once around that first turn, Allan shot a glance
over his shoulder and his heart leaped. Unless he was
very much mistaken, Burns had lost ground. That was
Allan’s last turn of the head. From that time on it
was merely a question of hugging the rim of the track
and enduring the ache of limb and chest, doubting all
the while his ability to hold his place and all the while
determining to do it.</p>

<p>He was right about Burns. That redoubtable runner
had gone to pieces all in the minute. At the second
turn he was plainly no longer dangerous to Allan, and
back at the finish the throng roared its relief and delight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
And while it was still shouting, Tammen shot
around Burns and began to lessen the dozen or so yards
between him and Allan. And Allan, hearing vaguely
a new note in the voices across the field and the rapid
pat of steps on the track behind him, guessed what was
up and felt his heart sink. Here was a man who could
sprint, something Allan had never been able to do satisfactorily,
and here, in all probability, was the winner
of the race! Those gazing obliquely across the oval
saw Allan falter for a stride just at the farther turn,
and their hearts sank.</p>

<p>But after that first instant of what was something
like terror, Allan pulled himself together. In his own
words, it was up to him to win, and win he would, if
only his breath would last that long. Tammen, three
yards behind him, made no attempt to pass him at the
turns, but kept himself in hand for the home-stretch.
And Allan, grim and determined, weakening with every
long gasp for breath, knew that when the track stretched
straight before him to the distant white line the battle
would really begin, and that in the length of that distance
the meeting would be won or lost.</p>

<p>And then he finished the turn and the rim ran
straight beside him. And then the <em>pat</em>, <em>pat</em> behind him
crept nearer and nearer. Presently, when the stretch
was half run, Allan was conscious, without looking&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
he dared not take his eyes from the track ahead&mdash;of
something grayish-white at his elbow.</p>

<p>The time had come to do the impossible, to spur his
weary limbs into renewed effort, to force his panting
lungs to greater exertion, and to keep that grayish blur
where it was. To have thrown himself&mdash;nay, to have
simply let himself drop onto the grass beside the track
and troubled no more about anything, would have been
at that moment the greatest pleasure of a lifetime.
But along the track voices were roaring and shrieking,
and, although the words were sounds only, the meaning
of them he knew. They wanted him to win, and the
desire found a new echo in his heart. He wanted to
win, and&mdash;why, yes, he <em>would</em> win!</p>

<p>And now the white line was in plain sight, although
he didn’t see it, and the roar of voices was rising and
growing. For a moment it seemed to him that he was
motionless, and that the dark ranks on either side were
moving slowly past him. And at the moment a glimpse
of whitish-gray at his right dispelled the illusion, and
with a sob for breath, he forced himself on. Once in
that remaining twenty yards he staggered, and the
watchers held their breaths for fear, but he recovered
himself and plunged, reeling, on&mdash;and on&mdash;and on.
Was there no end to it? he wondered, in agony. The
haunting blur beside him was gone now, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold up! Easy, man, easy!” cried a voice that
he seemed to know, and then dozens of arms were clutching
him, and he let himself go. And as his eyes closed
a whitish form passed before them and dropped from
sight. Tammen, plucky to the last, was being lifted
from the track, where, defeated and exhausted, he had
fallen. And Allan, with closed eyes and tortured lungs,
felt himself being carried to the tent, while in his ears
was a roar of sound that told of victory and a race
well run.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>“VALE”</small></h2>


<p>Allan and Pete sat on the steps of McLean Hall.
The yard was a fairyland of glowing lanterns and moving
colors. Near at hand, in a bough-screened stand,
the band was playing. Above their heads the old elms
of Erskine rustled their leaves and whispered among
themselves, comparing, perhaps, this class-day with the
many that had gone before. On the gravel paths matrons
and maids, in light gowns, accompanied by robed
seniors or dress-suited undergraduates, passed and repassed.
The scene was as fair a one as ever Allan had
witnessed, while even Pete was forced to grudging
admiration.</p>

<p>“You’ll come out in August, then,” Pete was saying.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Allan, “and don’t you be afraid I
won’t turn up, for this is the biggest excursion I ever
took. So far I’ve never been farther away from home
than this, and Colorado seems like the other side of the
world.”</p>

<p>Pete smiled in the half-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hope you’ll like us, Allan. We may seem rather
a rough and unpolished lot at first, but we’re not so bad
when you cotton to our way of life.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll like you,” said Allan, vehemently.
“If it wasn’t for you and your father, Pete, where’d
we be now?”</p>

<p>“Where you are, I guess,” laughed Pete. “Let me
tell you something, Allan. When you get out to Blackwater,
don’t you go to speaking pieces at the old man,
and thanking him; that’s a line of talk he can’t stand.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to thank him,” objected Allan.</p>

<p>“No you haven’t; your mother’s done that already
in her letter. Besides, there isn’t anything to make a
fuss about. I gave the tip to dad, and he bought up
enough stock in the Gold Beetle to get control. Then
he called a meeting, voted to go ahead with the mine,
and&mdash;did it. And he found a whole bunch of ore, just
as I knew he would. He don’t need any thanks. Why,
ginger, the old mine will make him richer than it will
you folks!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll thank you again,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“If you do, I’ll punch you! Look, there’s Rindgely
with his folks. Nice-looking woman, that mother of
his. Say, maybe I ain’t glad I didn’t have to show that
confession of him!”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” said Allan, heartily. “It would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
been a shame to prevent him from graduating. After
all, I don’t suppose he realized what he was doing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that,” answered Pete.
“Anyhow, I’m glad we caught on to him in time. And
it was all Two Spot’s doing, too; did you ever think of
that? If she hadn’t rolled that ball of paper to my
feet I’d never have seen that chap’s name and asked
about him. It was that that put me onto the game. I
remembered Tommy’s telling about Rindgely and the
St. Thomas Club. By the way, it’s time those fellows
showed up.”</p>

<p>“Tommy and Hal? They’re always late. Have
you heard Tommy’s voice? He cheered so hard at the
ball game this afternoon that he can’t talk above a
whisper. Hal’s trying to induce him to sing with the
glee club.”</p>

<p>“There’s Hooker and Long. What sort of a captain
do you suppose Long will make?”</p>

<p>“First rate, I should think. The fellows like him
and he’s a hard-working, earnest sort of a fellow.”</p>

<p>“Well, just as long as they didn’t light on Monroe,”
said Pete. “That man will be the death of me, he puts
on so many airs. Next fall, when I get back, I’m going
to start right in and learn how to throw the hammer,
and keep at it until I can beat him at that, too.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be busy at football,” suggested Allan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Football? Oh&mdash;well, maybe; football isn’t a bad
game, after all. But&mdash; Here they are. O Tommy!
Tommy Sweet!”</p>

<p>Tommy and Hal, attracted by Pete’s bellow, turned
and joined them.</p>

<p>“Thought we’d never get here,” said Tommy,
hoarsely. “Hal got mixed up with an ice-cream freezer
and ate six saucerfuls before I could drag him away.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Hal confessed. “That’s the trouble
with breaking training; things taste so good and it’s so
jolly nice to be able to eat all you want to. I expect to
be fine and sick to-night.”</p>

<p>“You have every right to,” said Allan. “When a
little old freshman gets taken onto the varsity and
makes a home run in the ninth inning, just when it’s
needed, and lets in three men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! And come on up to the room and
eat. We can hear the music finely from the windows.
I’ve got some nice cold ginger ale up there, and Mr. and
Mrs. Guild ought to be along about now. Come on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never took much of a shine to ginger ale,”
said Pete, drawing his big form erect; “the fizzy stuff
always goes up my nose. But I’ll have some, for it sure
is hot to-night.”</p>

<p>“We’ll drink Tommy’s health,” said Hal, as they
moved across the turf under the swaying lanterns, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
we’ll get him to sing us ‘A Health to King Charles’ in
his nice new voice.”</p>

<p>“Toast yourselves,” growled Tommy, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“We will!” cried Allan. “We’ll toast ourselves,
and we’ll drink to next year, when we’ll all be jolly
sophomores&mdash;except you, Tommy dear, who’ll be a
disgustingly serious and dignified junior.”</p>

<p>Laughing, they crossed the yard, under the glow of
the lanterns, and passed out of sight into the shadows of
Elm Street. Against the front of College Hall appeared
in sputtering purple flames the word</p>

<p>Mr. Butterworth portrays the future President at school, where, after a bitter disappointment,
the crusty old school-teacher, who has a good heart beneath his severe
exterior, says to him: “Never mind, you may be President yet.” He traces President
McKinley’s career through his army days to the time when he was preparing for that
great political career which made the blow that struck him down at the height of his
glory a blow to the whole United States.</p>

<p class="noic">“<i>For children, parents, teachers, and all who are interested
in the psychology of childhood.</i>”</p>


<p class="p2 noi"><span class="adtitle">The Book of Knight and Barbara.</span></p>

<p class="adauthor">By <span class="smcap">David Starr Jordan</span>. Illustrated. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>The curious and fascinating tales and pictures of this unique
book are introduced by Dr. Jordan with the following preface:
“The only apology the author can make in this case is that he
never meant to do it. He had told his own children many
stories of many kinds, some original, some imitative, some travesties
of the work of real story-tellers. Two students of the department
of education in the Stanford University&mdash;Mrs. Louise
Maitland, of San Jose, and Miss Harriet Hawley, of Boston&mdash;asked
him to repeat these stories before other children. Miss
Hawley, as a stenographer, took them down for future reference,
and while the author was absent on the Bering Sea Commission
of 1896 she wrote them out in full, thus forming the material
of this book. Copies of the stories were placed by Mrs. Maitland
in the hands of hundreds of children. These drew illustrative
pictures, after their fashion; and from the multitude
offered, Mrs. Maitland chose those which are here reproduced.
The scenes in the stories were also subjected to the criticisms
of the children, and in many cases amended to meet their suggestions.
These pictures made by the children have been found
to interest deeply other children, a fact which gives them a
definite value as original documents in the study of the workings
of the child-mind. At the end of the volume are added a few
true stories of birds and of beasts, told to a different audience.
With these are a few drawings by university students, which are
intended to assist the imagination of child-readers.”</p>

<p>Uncle Robert teaches children how to read aright the great book
of Nature. He makes study a pleasure. He teaches geography in the
right way. He makes rural life and occupations attractive. He has a
deep and loving sympathy with child-life. He believes in the education
that strengthens the body as well as the mind. He tells children
instructive stories to arouse their imaginations and stimulate their
observing powers. He believes that every normal child may be made
useful in the world. He has a boundless faith in human progress, and
finds his greatest hopes in childhood and its possibilities.</p>

<p><b>These extraordinarily suggestive little books by the late
Colonel Parker&mdash;one of the most far-sighted students of
child-life of our day&mdash;have approved themselves to thousands
of primary teachers. They form one of the few successful
attempts to incorporate that which is close by nature to
child perception into the very warp and woof of the child
mind. They give an intelligible meaning and vitality to
the round of experiences that come to all normal children in
our land.</b></p>
